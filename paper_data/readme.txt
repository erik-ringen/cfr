ISSUES ILARIA
-Bird_2002b Table2
	-values around the mean (mean plusminus number) are not defined. Interpreted as SE, given that is the measure used in the other tables, although this is not stated

-BliegeBird_1995 Table 3
	Notes on time from Caption: Foraging time includes travel, search and handling (harvesting and field processing)
	Egg time does not include travel time to the patch, which was shared with travel to the intertidal patch
	since egg collecting occurred within an intertidal foraging episode. To obtain total egg time, add 161 minutes to boy 1 and 2,
	103 to boy 5, 58 to girl 8

-BliegeBird_2002a 
	Many figures show the same data. Attention to repeated samples.
	I bypassed Tables 2, 3, 5. Can we extract data from these to compare with the raw data from other papers?

-BliegeBird_2002a Fig1a 
	y values are Residual overall returns (Kcal/hr+travel)

-BliegeBird_2002a Fig1b
	y values are Residual Beach Fishing Efficiency (Kcal/hr E/T)
	I think we can use the adult values of fig1a, same paper. But I would like second opinion.

-BliegeBird_2002a Fig2 and table
	Error reported as CI98. SD not calculated, because small sample size renders the calculation from CI98 unreliable.
	Hence, better to use the data and SD presented in the associated table (and the r script for that) instead of the figure.

-BliegeBird_2002a Fig4
	compared Children to Other men, ignored Best man
	sd was calculated from error, presented as CI95, with formula SD= vN X (upper limit - lower limit)/ 2*students' t value (for appropriate sample size) (2.776 for n=5, 2.306 for n=9)
	same data is presented in fig 3

-BliegeBird_2002a Fig5c
	Subset of figures 5a and b for children and teenagers, so probably redundant.
	Declared sample size is 15, but only 13 data points found.
	Adult averages and sd can be constructed from fig 5a and b, but probably not worth it, because data are repeated.

-BliegeBird_2002a Fig6 and table
	Error reported as CI98. SD not calculated, because small sample size renders the calculation from CI98 unreliable.
	Hence, better to use the data and SD presented in the associated table (and the r script for that) instead of the figure.

-BlurtonJones_1989 table2
	makalita and //ekwa tubers have been summed into tubers
	adult values only for fruits, maybe for tubers can be obtained from table4?
