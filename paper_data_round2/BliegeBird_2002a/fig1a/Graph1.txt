Graph 1:Simple linear regression of residual return rates on age with 95% confidence interval for the slope, one outlier removed (open circle): y = -130.1 x x; R = .217, F = 1.731, R2= .047, p = .197, n = 33 individuals over 98 follows. Using residual overall returns controls for variation resulting from differences in the number of observations for each individual--as the number of observations rises, the average return rate also rises. To control for this effect, we use the residuals from a regression of overall return rate on number of observations per individual forager (y = 133.126 + 51.086 ¥ x; R = .353, F = 3.85, R2 = .097, p = .05) The outlier represented by the open circle is the mean observed return from one 62-year-old male with a reputation for being the best beach fisher- man in the village. His returns are dramatically higher than those of any other man or woman in his age category; including him in the regression gives the resulty=-262.093 +8.143x x;R=.353,F=5.120,R2=.125,p=.030,n=34individuals over 104 follows. The 34 individuals in the sample were self-selected and were randomly chosen as focal-follow subjects during scans of beach fishing locations. Each individual included in this sample was observed fishing more than once. Return rates represent the average of all observed fishing episodes, lumping both small-hook and large-hook fishing methods. There is no significant effect of an individual forager's sex on beach fishing residual re- turn rates: ANOVA, F = 1.92, p = .174.
