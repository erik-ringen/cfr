Beach fishing efficiency across age categories. Mean hand-line foraging efficiency(kcal/hr) across age categories in large-hook beach fishing for 34 in- dividuals observed in 104 bouts. Error bars represent the 98% confidence in- terval for the mean return rates in each category. There is a significant effect of age category on foraging efficiency (ANOVA: df = 29, F = 8.557, p = .0001), but post-hoc tests reveal that the only significant differences are between those aged 51+ and younger age categories (see Table 2).
