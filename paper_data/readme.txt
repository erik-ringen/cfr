NOTES

	General: 

Age rounding - Ages extracted from plots were rounded when the raw age was very close to round numbers (e.g.14.96, 7.02), and not when some of the values were in between (e.g. 13.53).

	By paper:

Bird_2002b 
Table2: values around the mean (mean ± number) are not defined. Interpreted as SE, given that is the measure used in the other tables, although this is not stated

Bird_2005

BliegeBird_1995
 Table 3: “Foraging time includes travel, search and handling (harvesting and field processing)”, but for egg returns, as they were collected during other trips. The reported time was recalculated to include travel time per each resource, (i.e. travel time was added to the time used to collect the eggs, as from text: “Egg time does not include travel time to the patch, which was shared with travel to the intertidal patch since egg collecting occurred within an intertidal foraging episode. To obtain total egg time, add 161 minutes to boy 1 and 2, 103 to boy 5, 58 to girl 8”).

BliegeBird_2002a 
Many figures show the same data. A number of outcomes has not been considered. In detail:
-Fig 1a, 1b and 2 all report beach fishing efficiency.  Not clear what's the difference between them. Used figures 1a and 1b.
-fig 3 and 4 both report spearfishing efficiency. Used fig 3 only.
-fig 5 a, b, c all are shellfishing efficiency. a and b are divided by sex, while c is a subset of the children. Used fig 5a and 5b.
Data are presented as Residual overall returns  (Kcal/hr+travel) and Efficiency. The first includes negative values. For both, unit used: “net kcal/hr”.
Fig5c: Declared sample size is 15, but only 13 data points found. Used only 5a and 5b (total sum <20 = 15 as declared here).
Fig6 and table: Not used.

BlurtonJones_1989 
Table2: individuals identified by original ids (e.g. SUSA or ADAM)
Table2: makalita and //ekwa tubers have been summed into tubers.

BlurtonJones_1997 
Figure 1 and 2: have data from multiple years. Some individuals are repeated, but no info is given on which ones, so they are treated as independent data. Hence, the data from each figure is considered a single outcome

BlurtonJones_2002
Figure 1 shows data that might not be originally collected for this paper, details not provided. Included.
Figure 4 and 5: One reports data relative only to //ekwa, the other to all tubers. The first has also sex info, the other reports school attendance. Using both, but probably data from figure 4 are included in figure 5.

Bock_2005

Crittenden_2013 
fig 2 values in logarithm. Not clear base of the log, used natural log.

Froehle_2018
Data extracted only from table4, as the rest seem redundant. Resource type is not specified, input 'mixed'.

Gurven_2006
data reported as cal/h, changed to kcal/h. Data excluded in favor of cchunts dataset.

Hawkes_1995 
Table 2: was used as a source of information on children for the other tables. Used for all the tables.
Table 4: adult values for tin measured berries from table 5.  
Table 5: assumed age composition from table 2 - so age interval, mean and sd entered from that table
Table 5: these are tin measured rates
Table 6: all the measures are for tafabe, a berry, and differ from fig 5 because are in kcal instead of grams
Table 6: presents several measures for tafabe. Only one is probably worth using, e.g. calories picked in a certain amount of time (tin measured).  Other measures are calories remaining in the stash after people eat the berries while picking, consumed calories, proportion of picked berries stashed, instead of being eaten.
Table 6: assumed age composition from table 2 - so age interval, mean and sd entered from that table
Table 6: check that the way I combined standard errors of adults to compare children values is correct
Used Table 4 only.

Kaplan_1995
Only loesch curves.

Kaplan_1994
Only loesch curves.

Koster_2007
Data impossible to extract from plots, as presented very weirdly.
	
Kramer_2009a 
Single result below 20y. Not used.

Pollom_inpress
No actual return data available.

Tucker_2005 
All ages are reported as age ranks and not estimated age. Age group boundaries assigned according to what reported in the 2003 paper.

Walker_2002
fig 2b has same data as 2a, but with individual connected across decades. Subsetting to age <20 hides the connections, of course, so probably only redundant data. Data excluded in favor of cchunts dataset.
