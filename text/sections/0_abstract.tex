\section*{Abstract}
Children forage in a vast array of societies, spanning from traditional hunter gatherer groups such as the Hadza to mexican shanty towns. Data on their success, though, is sparse and a coherent framework is missing. With this paper we aim at both reviewing the extant literature on children foraging and at summarizing available return data in a single coherent meta-analytical framework. Moreover we focus on one specific hypothesis tested by some of the papers we analyse, and discuss how these papers draw their conclusions from data.
