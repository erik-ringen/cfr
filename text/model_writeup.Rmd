## Generative model

Assume that individuals go on foraging trips in which they either successfully acquire some return with probability $1-p$ ($y > 0$) or come home empty-handed ($y = 0$) with probability $p$. Further assume that non zero returns follow a log-normal distribution. Observed foraging returns are thus described by a "hurdle" model where:

$$ f(y) = \textrm{Bernoulli}(p)  ~~~~\textrm{if}~~y=0 \\ $$
$$ f(y) = (1-p) \times(\textrm{LogNormal}(\textrm{log}(\mu),\sigma)) ~~~~\textrm{if}~~y>0  $$

Previous studies of human foraging returns have found that both the probability of a zero-return and the quantity of returns depends on forager skill ($S$), which varies across the lifespan. In the language of causal inference, $\textrm{age} \rightarrow S \rightarrow p$ and $S \rightarrow \mu$. Koster et al. modeled the relationship between age and $S$ as a concave function to account for skill senescence among older adults. However, our focus was on the returns of foragers below age 20---more than a decade earlier than the estimated peak of foraging skill, so we did not model senescence. Otherwise, we used the same functional form as Koster et al. (2019) and Lew-Levy et al. (2021) to describe change in latent foraging skill with age:

$$S(\textrm{age}) = (1 - \textrm{exp}(-k\times \textrm{age}))^{b}$$

Where $k$ is the constant rate of growth in foraging skill and $b$ is an elasticity parameter that determines the proportional change in skill. $b$ < 1 indicates diminishing returns (decreasing differentials of skill with age), while $b$ > 1 indicates accelerating returns (increasing differentials of skill with age). Skill itself may have nonlinear effects on foraging success, which we model with elasticity parameters $\eta$. $k$, $b$, and $\eta$ were assumed positive, which means that skill is strictly increasing with age and that higher skill always has a positive effect on foraging returns. Finally, we included linear parameters $\alpha$ that act as an intercepts for foraging returns, independent of age.

$$ \mu = S^{\eta_{[\mu]}}\alpha_{\mu} $$ 
$$ p = 2(\textrm{logit}^{-1}(S^{\eta_{[p]}}\alpha_{p}) - \frac{1}{2}) $$

## Integrating individual-level data with study-level summary statistics

Our dataset included a mix of individual-level returns and summary statistics, such as the mean and standard deviation of returns for children/adults.

## What if no adult returns are available?



## Individual differences


## Uncertainty in age 


## Uncertainty in sex


Absolute values of foraging returns are not likely to be directly comparable between or even within studies (if, for example the study reported returns for two different resource types). However, the target of our meta-analysis was not absolute production, but instead children's foraging productivity \it{relative} to adults. Therefore we scaled returns $y$ by the mean adult return in a given study and resource type.
