	abstract = {This article provides an overview of the phenomena of ‘‘dietary acculturation’’ and the ‘‘nutrition transition’’. The term dietary acculturation is defined, and a proposed model for how dietary acculturation occurs is presented. Various approaches to assessing dietary acculturation in research studies are discussed, and a research-driven discussion of the possible consequences of dietary acculturation on diet and health is presented. The concept of the nutrition transition and the importance of understanding this phenomenon are presented. Specifically, the term nutrition transition is defined, highlighting characteristic dietary changes, as well as shifts in physical activity and obesity trends. The paradox of continued high rates of malnutrition in developing countries and a new emergence of dietary excess, sedentary behavior, obesity, and other chronic diseases in middle- and upper-class persons in these countries will also be addressed. The article concludes with suggestions for future research in the areas of dietary acculturation and the nutrition transition. Key words: acculturation, diet, dietary acculturation, dietary behavior, ethnicity, immigration, nutrition transition, obesity, physical activity, race.},

	abstract = {This study describes the contributions of various types of caregivers to the direct provisioning and feeding of Aka children in households reliant on foraging in Congo. Ecological and family factors that predict allomaternal caregiving (i.e., caregiving by individuals other than mothers) are identiﬁed and discussed in light of current anthropological and public health perspectives on child feeding and cooperative caregiving. The study is based on 8 months of ethnographic ﬁeldwork in the Republic of Congo in 2004 and 2005, and utilizes naturalistic observations of 22 focal children between two and four years of age. Observations spanned 12 daylight hours spread out over three different days. The results of this study demonstrate that even though mothers were the single highest contributor to child feeding, combined allomaternal contributions (i.e., contributions by fathers, grandmothers, aunts, siblings, and cousins) to child feeding was higher than that of mothers. Furthermore, birth order and the transition in families to having a new infant predicted allomaternal contributions. These results reinforce the need to extend public health and nutrition education programs to target more than just parents, as other individuals may have substantial inﬂuence over child feeding patterns. Furthermore, these results exemplify a cooperative child rearing pattern that is consistent with behavioral ecology perspectives that have suggested that humans evolved as cooperative childrearers rather than as maternal-centric or parentonly childrearers. Lastly, individual child and family characteristics predicted allomaternal contributions to child feeding and therefore research and public health initiatives need to consider variation in child and family characteristics in order to accurately describe and serve populations throughout the world.},

These models predict patterns of prey choice, habitat use, time allocation, settlement pattern, and foraging group size that will maximize some objective currency (such as the net rate of energy capture while foraging) under the constraints of resource characteristics and forager capabilities pertaining to a particular situation. Issues raised in anthropological critiques of optimal foraging theory are also discussed, including (1) the models' degree of realism, (2) the validity of neo-Darwinian assumptions and simple energetic-efficiency currencies, (3) the need to incorporate the effects of risk and uncertainty, and (4) the relation of individual decision-making to processes occuring at larger spatial and temporal scales. Despite the validity of certain criticisms, optimal foraging theory appears to offer a useful addition to more orthodox analyses of hunter-gatherer subsistence patterns and may help reconcile the empirically described diversity of these patterns with the search for general explanations.},

	shorttitle = {Growing up {Mikea}},
	abstract = {Human childhood poses interrelated evolutionary, economic, and ecological
puzzles. The evolutionary puzzle is that the human juvenile period is
considerably longer than the premature developmental periods in other
great apes, making long childhood a derived trait of potential significance
(Bock and Sellen 2002b). Humans invest in growth and delay the start of
reproduction for 15 to 20 years (Bogin 1999; Hill and Kaplan 1999). This
seems contrary to Darwinian logic because a long childhood period has
the potential to increase risk of mortality prior to reproductive maturation.
Natural selection could favor prolonged investment in growth and delayed
reproduction for several reasons. First, the costs of reduced fertility
could be overridden by the mortality-reducing benefits of a long training
period, such as a longer period to learn difficult foraging tasks (Kaplan et
al. 2000). Second, long childhood could be a side effect of selection for a
long lifespan more generally. Among mammals, body size, lifespan, and
the length of the juvenile period are highly correlated (Charnov 1993, 2001;
Charnov and Berrigan 1993). Our goal with this chapter is to examine children’s foraging behavior in
what is probably one of the best environments for young foragers. The
Mikea Forest of southwestern Madagascar is a safe place for children.
The dense dry tropical forest contains almost no predators and few poisonous
plants and animals. Within this forest, Mikea forage for wild tubers,
small game, and honey in addition to cultivating maize and manioc, herding
livestock, and participating in market-oriented activities. Mikea children
as young as four or five successfully unearth wild Dioscorea tubers for
household consumption. Mikea children tuber foragers have exceptionally
high net acquisition rates, averaging between 536 net kilocalories/hour for
girls and 504 net kilocalories/hour for boys. As such, the Mikea example
offers a potentially interesting test case for theories of juvenile dependency
and foraging strategies.},

	abstract = {Humans have a much longer juvenile period (weaning to first reproduction, 14 or more years) than their closest relatives (chimpanzees, 8 years). Three explanations are prominent in the literature. (a) Humans need the extra time to learn their complex subsistence techniques. (b) Among mammals, since length of the juvenile period bears a constant relationship to adult lifespan, the human juvenile period is just as expected. We therefore only need to explain the elongated adult lifespan, which can be explained by the opportunity for older individuals to increase their fitness by providing for grandchildren. (c) The recent model by Kaplan and colleagues suggests that longevity and investment in "embodied capital" will coevolve, and that the need to learn subsistence technology contributed to selection for our extended lifespan.We report experiments designed to test the first explanation: human subsistence technology takes many years to learn, and spending more time learning it gives reproductive benefits that outweight lost time. Taking away some of this time should lead to deficits in efficiency. We paid Hadza foragers to participate in tests of important subsistence skills. We compared efficiency of males and females at digging tubers. They differ greatly in time spent practicing digging but show no difference in efficiency. Children who lost "bush experience" by spending years in boarding school performed no worse at digging tubers or target archery than those who had spent their entire lives in the bush. Climbing baobab trees, an important and dangerous skill, showed no change with age among those who attempted it. We could show no effects of practice time.These findings do not support what we label "the practice theory," but we discuss ways in which the theory could be defended; for example, some as-yet-untested skill may be greatly impaired by loss of a few years of the juvenile period. Our data also show that it is not safe to assume that increases in skill with age are entirely due to learning or practice; they may instead be due to increases in size and strength.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The Hadza foragers of Tanzania are currently experiencing a nutritional shift
that includes the intensification of domesticated cultigens in the diet. Despite these
changes, no study, to date, has examined the possible effects of this transition on the
food collection behavior of young foragers.
Methods: Here, we present a cross-sectional study on foraging behavior taken from
two time points, 2005 and 2017. We compare the number of days foraged and the type
and amount of food collected for young foragers, aged 5-14 years, in age and season
matched samples.
Results: Compared to 2005, in 2017 fewer sub-adults left camp to forage and, overall,
targeted a smaller variety of wild foods, with the noticeable absence of wild honey, figs,
and tubers. In addition, participants in 2017 were significantly more likely to have
attended formal schooling. Despite the increased presence of domesticated plant
foods in the diet and increased attendance at school, some young foragers continue to
remain highly productive in collecting wild, non-domesticated foods.
Conclusions: This is the first study to explore the transitioning diet of young Hadza
foragers. Despite the preliminary nature of our results, our findings suggest that the
range of wild foods targeted by sub-adults is decreasing as the amount of
domesticated cultigens in the diet increases. These data underscore the importance of
studying diet composition and foraging decisions across temporal, nutritional, and
ecological landscapes.},

	abstract = {Life history theory places central importance on relationships between ontogeny, reproduction, and mortality. Fast human life histories have been theoretically and empirically associated with high mortality regimes. This relationship, however, poses an unanswered question about energy allocation. In epidemiologically stressful environments, a greater proportion of energy is allocated to immune function. If growth and maintenance are competing energetic expenditures, less energy should be available for growth, and the mechanism to sustain rapid maturation remains unclear. The human pattern of extended juvenile provisioning and resource sharing may provide an important source of variation in energy availability not predicted by tradeoff models that assume independence at weaning. We consider a group of South American foragers to evaluate the effects that pooled energy budgets may have on early reproduction. Despite growing up in an environment with distinct seasonal under-nutrition, harsh epidemiological conditions, and no health care, Pumé girls mature quickly and initiate childbearing in their midteens. Pooled energy budgets compensate for the low productivity of girls not only through direct food transfers but importantly by reducing energy they would otherwise expend in foraging activities to meet metabolic requirements. We suggest that pooled energy budgets affect energy availability at both extrinsic and intrinsic levels. Because energy budgets are pooled, Pumé girls and young women are buffered from environmental downturns and can maximize energy allocated to growth completion and initiate reproduction earlier than a traditional bound-energy model would predict.},

Our two aims were (1) to clarify their time use and participation in food procurement activities and (2) to evaluate their contribution to food acquisition. The authors accompanied the children on an 8-day hunt and conducted direct observations on six children, focusing on one of them each day (12 h; 06:00–18:00). All foods brought back to the camp were identified and weighed, and their energy and protein values were calculated. Children were considered to be generally physically active, and they participated in food procurement activities about 3 h in a day, which was nearly the same amount of time as the Baka adults spent on those activities. Boys mainly spent their time rat hunting (101.7 min), while girls spent more time bail fishing (120.3 min) than rat hunting (60.0 min). Although the children spent more time foraging and had a greater number of participants engaged in it, the total amount of game that adults obtained was much greater (2787 g obtained by children and 12,273 g by adults). Each game brought back by adults (e.g., tortoises or vipers) was also generally heavier than that of children (e.g., rats or galago). Children often move in groups of four to eight people and perform most food acquisition activities with at least three to four people. Regarding the transition of their activity patterns as they got older, we hypothesized that boys tend to act alone or in smaller units, whereas girls continue to act in groups that contain people of various ages.},

	abstract = {Human hunting is arguably one of the most difﬁcult activities common to foraging peoples now and in the past. Children and teenagers have usually been described as incompetent hunters in ethnographies of hunter-gatherers. This paper explores the extent to which adult-level competence is limited more by the constraints of physical capital, or body size, and brain-based capital, or skills and learning. The grandmother hypothesis requires that production is an increasing function of size alone, while the embodied capital model stipulates that production is a function of both size and delayed learning. Tests based on observational, interview, and experimental data collected among Tsimane Amerindians of the Bolivian Amazon suggest that size alone cannot explain the long delay until peak hunting productivity. Indirect encounters (e.g., smells, sounds, tracks, and scat) and shooting of stationary targets are two components of hunting ability limited primarily by physical size alone, but the more difﬁcult components of huntingddirect encounters with important prey items and successful capturedrequire substantial skill. Those skills can take an additional ten to twenty years to develop after achieving adult body size.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To determine the effects of age and sex on physical activity and time budgets of Hadza children and juveniles, 5-14 years old, including both in-camp and out-of-camp activities.
Methods: Behavioral data were derived from {\textasciitilde}15 000 hourly in-camp scan observations of 76 individuals and 13 out-of-camp focal follows on nine individuals. The data were used to estimate energy expended and percentage of time engaged in a variety of routine activities, including food collection, childcare, making and repairing tools, and household maintenance.
Results: Our results suggest that (1) older children spend more time in economic activities; (2) females spend more time engaged in work-related and economic activities in camp, whereas males spend more time engaged in economic activities out of camp; and (3) foraging by both sexes tends to net caloric gains despite being energetically costly.
Conclusions: These results show that, among the Hadza, a sexual division of labor begins to emerge in middle childhood and is well in place by adolescence. Furthermore, foraging tends to provide net caloric gains, suggesting that children are capable of reducing at least some of the energetic burden they place upon their parents or alloparents. The findings are relevant to our understanding of the ways in which young foragers allocate their time, the development of sex-specific behavior patterns, and the capacity of children's work efforts to offset the cost of their own care in a cooperative breeding environment.},

	abstract = {The longstanding view that children among foraging populations are largely dependent on the food collection
efforts of others is an assumed and implicit characteristic of several models of human life history and family
formation. The evolution of protracted juvenility in humans is often explained using the “embodied capital
model” which argues that prolonged investment in growth and delayed reproduction evolved because a long
training period is required to learn difficult foraging tasks and become a self-sufficient forager. The model
suggests that if juvenile investment in growth and learning yields an increase in adult productivity, then
selection will favor delayed maturity, long life span, and increased brain size. Here, we test the embodied
capital model with naturalistic foraging and consumption data among juvenile Hadza hunter–gatherers of
Tanzania to determine the extent to which children self-provision. We found that sex had a significant effect
on both the type and the amount of food brought back to camp and consumed while out foraging; compared
to their male counterparts, young female foragers consumed less while foraging and returned to camp with
more food. A wide variation in caloric returns was seen across all foragers in the sample. When analyzing only
food brought back to camp, age was not a significant predictor. When combining the amount of food back to
camp and the amount consumed while out foraging, however, older children consistently collected more
food. The data presented here suggest that although older children do appear to have greater overall foraging
success, even very young children are capable of collecting a considerable amount of food. Our data, although
lending support to the embodied capital model, suggest that although foraging efficiency increases with age, it
remains difficult to determine if this efficiency is a byproduct of learning, strength, or perhaps individual
motivation. In addition, our results indicate that juvenile self-provisioning may have played a key role in the
evolution of food sharing and cooperation during hominin evolution.},

In this chapter we present some analyses provoked by the idea that this agenda (Dr. Freedman's work encouraged us to think about the child's own agenda) centers around the child's survival and future reproduction. These issues might be easier to investigate in the hunting and gathering economy in which our species evolved. Although it seems to have gained a footing in anthropology, the adaptationist paradigm is seldom employed in psychology, yet it addresses many of the same aspects of behavior as interest psychologists. In this chapter we are writing about outcomes of behavior, and the effects of these on evolutionary fitness. Our assumption is that the behavior of organisms is often efficient (and so are the mechanisms by which behavior is acquired) in the sense that the organism responds to a range of circumstances in such a way as to produce the behavior that most enhances fitness under those circumstances. Thus behavior will vary with circumstances in ways that are predictable--if we can work out which of two alternative ways of behaving would most enhance fitness in a particular set of circumstances then we can predict which behavior we expect to see.

For fishing and spearfishing, which are cognitively difficult, we can find no significant amount of variability in return rates because of experiential factors correlated with age. However, for shellfish collecting, which is relatively easy to learn, there are strong age-related effects on efficiency. Children reach adult efficiency more quickly in fishing as compared to shellfish collecting, probably owing to the size and strength constraints of the latter.},

Estimating the distribution of foraging returns is complicated by (1) the zero-inflated nature of hunting returns, as many if not most trips fail, and (2) the substantial variation among hunters, independent of age. We develop a multilevel mixture analysis of human foraging data to address these difficulties. Using a previously published 20-year record of hunts by 147 individual Aché hunters in eastern Paraguay, we estimate returns-by-age functions for both hunting failures and the size of harvests, while also estimating the heterogeneity among hunters. Consistent with previous analyses, we find that most hunters peak around 40 years of age. We can also show, however, that much more of the variation among Aché hunters arises from heterogeneity in failure rates (zero returns), not harvest sizes. We also introduce a new R package, glmer2stan, to assist in defining and fitting similar multilevel mixture models.},

To test these hypotheses, we used high-resolution proximity data from 1,701 child–alloparent dyads. Our results indicated that reciprocity and relatedness were positively associated with the number of interactions with a child (our proxy for childcare). Need appeared more influential in close kin, suggesting indirect benefits, while reciprocity proved to be a stronger influence in non-kin, pointing to direct benefits. However, despite shared genes, close and distant kin interactions were also contingent on reciprocity. Compared with other apes, humans are unique in rapidly producing energetically demanding offspring. Our results suggest that the support that mothers require is met through support based on kinship and reciprocity.},

	abstract = {Human children are highly dependent, requiring intensive maternal investment for a considerable length of time. As such, it is unlikely throughout our evolutionary history that mothers could have reared multiple dependent children and maintained high fertility without the assistance of allomothers (nonmaternal caregivers). Cross-culturally, mothers are primary caregivers and maternal investment is unequivocally tied to child well-being. Yet, child rearing is a distributed endeavor. Human prosociality and the ubiquitous nature of allomaternal investment are evident around the world. These traits and characteristics situate humans under the umbrella of cooperative breeding species – allomothers are essential to child development and contribute to positive developmental outcomes. Therefore, the greater social and caregiving environment in which children are raised is an integral part of child well-being. This chapter explores our current understanding regarding the cross-cultural context, depth, and breadth of allomaternal investment, reviewing allomaternal direct and indirect effects on child survivorship and physical, social, and emotional development. The cooperative nature of human child rearing suggests that others should not be regarded as supplementary; rather, allomothers are crucial contributors to well-being across the early life course.},

While cooperative childrearing is often presumed ancient, the transition from maternal self-reliance to dependence on allocare leaves no known empirical record. In this paper, an exploratory model is developed that incorporates probable evolutionary changes in birth intervals, juvenile dependence, and dispersal age to predict under what life history conditions mothers are unable to raise children without adult cooperation. The model’s outcome variable (net balance) integrates dependent children’s production and consumption as a function of varying life history parameters to estimate the investment mothers or others have to spend subsidizing children. Results suggest that maternal-juvenile cooperation can support the early transition toward a reduction in birth intervals, a longer period of juvenile dependence, and having overlapping young. The need for adult cooperation is most evident when birth intervals are short and age at net production is late. Findings suggest that the needs of juveniles would not have been an early selective force for adult cooperation. Rather, an age-graded division of labor and the mutual benefits of maternal-juvenile cooperation could be an important, but overlooked step in the evolution of cooperative breeding.},

models of human life-history evolution accounting for prolonged development,
extended lifespan and menopause. Integrating these models with
Hamilton’s theory of inclusive fitness, we predict that the interaction of biological
kinship with the age-schedule of resource production should be a
key driver of intergenerational transfers. In the empirical case of Tsimane’
forager–horticulturalists in Bolivian Amazonia, we provide a detailed characterization
of net transfers of food according to age, sex, kinship and the net
need of donors and recipients. We show that parents, grandparents and siblings
provide significant net downward transfers of food across generations.
We demonstrate that the extent of provisioning responds facultatively to variation
in the productivity and demographic composition of families, as
predicted by the theory. We hypothesize that the motivation to provide
these critical transfers is a fundamental force that binds together human
nuclear and extended families. The ubiquity of three-generational families in
human societies may thus be a direct reflection of fundamental evolutionary
constraints on an organism’s life-history and social organization.},

Aims: This study has three aims as below; (1) to develop a smoothed growth curve, (2) to elucidate the presence of adolescent growth spurt and (3) to assess the correlation of growth pattern factors to their final short stature. Subjects and methods: Anthropometric measurements including height and weight were carried out for 626 Baka children in southeast Cameroon. LMS method and Preece-Baines function were adopted to develop a smoothed growth curve and to assess their growth pattern. Results: The height velocity curve and acceleration curve derived from the LMS method showed the presence of an adolescent growth spurt. Biological parameters indicated their spurt was extremely weak and started at nearly the same time as published populations. Height gains between take-off and final height were almost equal between Baka children and children in published populations. Conclusion: The presence of a weak adolescent growth spurt is suggested in the growth pattern of Pygmy hunter-gatherers. Moreover, their short adult stature is possibly related to growth rate before onset of puberty.},

	abstract = {The foraging niche is characterized by the exploitation of nutrient-rich resources using complex extraction techniques that take a long time to acquire. This costly period of development is supported by intensive parental investment. Although human life history theory tends to characterize this investment in terms of food and care, ethnographic research on foraging skill transmission suggests that the flow of resources from old-to-young also includes knowledge. Given the adaptive value of information, parents may have been under selection pressure to invest knowledge – e.g., warnings, advice – in children: proactive provisioning of reliable information would have increased offspring survival rates and, hence, parental fitness. One way that foragers acquire subsistence knowledge is through symbolic communication, including narrative. Tellingly, oral traditions are characterized by an old-to-young transmission pattern, which suggests that, in forager groups, storytelling might be an important means by which adults transfer knowledge to juveniles. In particular, by providing juveniles with vicarious experience, storytelling may expand episodic memory, which is believed to be integral to the generation of possible future scenarios (i.e., planning). In support of this hypothesis, this essay reviews evidence that: mastery of foraging knowledge and skill sets takes a long time to acquire; foraging knowledge is transmitted from parent to child; the human mind contains adaptations specific to social learning; full assembly of learning mechanisms is not complete in early childhood; and forager oral traditions contain a wide range of information integral to occupation of the foraging niche. It concludes with suggestions for tests of the proposed hypothesis.

“The cognitive ability to represent situations removed from the immediate sensory field is… basic to the social hunting and gathering adaptation. In particular, the capacity to recreate situations for others and to convey to them what has been found to be of interest and of value has been of great adaptive worth” (Biesele, 1993, p. 42).},

	shorttitle = {Nutrition transition of {Hadza} {Foragers}},
	abstract = {The Hadza foragers of Tanzania are undergoing early stages of nutrition transition and
an increased level of market integration. Accompanying these shifts is a significant change in
diet composition with greater access to maize, wheat, and other domesticated cultigens, even in
the most remote bush camps. Despite the rapid rate of nutrition transition, few studies have
attempted to quantify the possible effects this transition is having on Hadza diet or foraging
behaviors. Here, we attempt to fill this gap in the literature by reporting results of a mixed
methods cross-sectional study on juvenile foragers taken from two time points, 2005 and 2017.
During the summer of 2017 we conducted detailed interviews and recorded in camp food
returns for a sample of young Hadza foragers aged 5-14 years. Comparing our 2017 data to age
matched data collected in 2005, our results indicate that juveniles are targeting a smaller variety
of wild foods, with noticeable absences of food species that have historically been considered
staples in Hadza diet (e.g. honey, tubers, figs). Accompanying these dietary shifts are important
behavioral changes, such as a smaller percentage of juveniles residing in camps going out to
forage in 2017 compared to 2005. Additionally, semi-structured interview data suggests that
maize has become a reliable staple food. However, despite changes in foraging return
composition, increased reliance on maize, and a reduction in the overall percentage of children
producing foraging returns, we found that some juveniles still remain highly productive foragers
in the midst of nutrition transition. These data have important implications for understanding the
decisions that foragers make in shifting ecological landscapes, monitoring the health outcomes
of Hadza juveniles, and the use and interpretation of data generated from contemporary Hadza
research in the 21st century.},

The evolution of widespread food sharing in humans helped shape cooperation, family formation, life history, language, and the development of economies of scale. While the behavioral and ecological correlates of food sharing among adults are widely studied, very little is known about food sharing among children. Here, in the first study to analyze the food sharing patterns of hunter-gatherer children, we show that while sharing may be biased towards kin, reciprocity characterizes the majority of all sharing dyads, both related and unrelated. These data lend support to the recent claim that discrimination among kin might be linked with reciprocal altruism theory. Furthermore, we show that age positively correlates with an increase in sharing, both in frequency and amount, supporting recent suggestions that prosocial behaviors and egalitarianism develop strongly in middle childhood when children acquire the normative rules of their society.},

	abstract = {Among the Hazda hunter-gatherers of Tanzania, children are active foragers and collect various types of wild plant foods and hunt small sized prey animals. The collection effort of Hazda children is reported to have a positive effect on a mother’s foraging yield (Bulurton-Jones et at. 1994, Journal of Anthropological Research 50(3): 217; Hawkes et al. 1995, Current Anthropology 36(4): 688), yet few quantitative data are available on the caloric values of children’s foods and the ways in which children distribute their own foraging yield. Here, we report on foraging return rates, consumption data, and the compositional values for several of the plant foods collected by children. Due to predator pressure, it is not safe for children to wander far from camp without adult supervision, therefore they typically focus on foods that are close to camp and easy to collect and process. We calculated the caloric content for the following foods: baobab fruit (346 kcal/100g dry matter (DM)), berries (320 kcal/100g DM), legumes (311 kcal/100g DM), drupes (325 kcal/100g DM), and figs (365 kcal/100g DM). Legumes, drupes, and figs have not been previously analyzed; our values for baobab and berries agree with previous analyses (Murray et al. 2001, Journal of Food Consumption and Analysis 14: 3). In addition, we calculated foraging return rates and daily consumption values for children. Our results suggest that they collect a significant portion of their daily caloric intake and act as allomothers providing caloric contributions to other children.

Thus, play may have made important contributions to the evolution of childhood through the development of embodied capital. Using data from Aka foragers and Ngandu farmer children from the Central African Republic, we ask whether children perform ethno- and gender-typical play and work activities, and whether play prepares children for complex work. Focal follows of 50 Aka and 48 Ngandu children were conducted with the aim of recording children’s participation in 12 categories of work and work-themed play. Using these data, we test a set of hypotheses regarding how age, gender, ethnicity, and task complexity influence children’s activities. As hypothesized, we find performance of work-themed play is negatively correlated with age. Contrary to our hypothesis, children do not play more than they work at complex tasks, but they work more than they play at simple ones. Gender and ethnicity are associated with play and work at culturally salient activities, despite availability of other-gender and other-ethnicity social partners. Our findings show that ethnic and gender biases are apparent in the play and work behavior of Aka and Ngandu children. Moreover, our results show that play helps both forager and farmer children learn complex skills, consistent with play having an adaptive learning function.},

Evolutionary research can benefit Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) practice and policy by elucidating the ways in which our evolved psychology and biology inform how we should best provide care options in different socio-ecological or cultural contexts. Indeed, human childrearing is of significant interest to evolutionary researchers. Compared to other species, the degree to which humans cooperate in the care and education of their young is unique in the natural world. Outside of human societies, it is rare to find animals helping to raise young who are not genetic kin. Many of the traits that characterize us as a species – long lives, slow growth and maturation, extensive cooperation, adept social learning, and complex culture – have been in one way or another hypothesized to have a deep evolutionary relationship with the tendency of human groups to bring up children together.},

Using structured questionnaires, we collected data among 69 children and 175 adults to assess the ability to name, identify, and conceptualize animals and wild edibles. We found that some of the ecological knowledge related to little mammals and birds reported by Baka children was not reported by adults. We also found similarities between children’s and adult’s knowledge, both regarding the content of knowledge and how knowledge is distributed. Thus, middle childhood children hold similar knowledge than adults, especially related to wild edibles. Moreover, as children age, they start shedding child-specific knowledge and holding more adult’s knowledge. Additionally and echoing the gendered knowledge distribution present in adulthood, since middle childhood there are differences in the knowledge hold by boys and girls. We discuss our results highlighting the existence of specific ecological knowledge held by Baka children, the overlap between children’s and adults’ knowledge, and the changes in children’s ecological knowledge as they move into adulthood.},

This lengthened period1 is often attributed to the time required for youth to master the culture, particularly subsistence and survival skills. But studies in increasing number show that children become skilled well before they gain complete independence and adult status. As children learn through play and participation in the domestic economy, they seem to be acquiring a “reserve capacity” of skills and knowledge that may not be fully employed for many years. To resolve this paradox, the theory offered here poses that this reserve capacity of children, both individually and collectively, can be rapidly activated to offset a shortfall in familial resources brought on by crises such as the loss of older family members. Additionally, social forces engendered by war, disease, famine, and economic change may lead to the wholesale recruitment of children into the labor force—with consequent attenuation of the developmental opportunities of an extended juvenility. In effect, humans display a primary life history strategy and an accelerated strategy with a shortened period of dependency. A wide array of cases from anthropology and history will be offered in support of this proposal.},

Studying how children learn foraging skills can, therefore, provide us with key data to test theories about the evolution of human life history, cognition, and social behavior. Modern foragers, with their vast cultural and environmental diversity, have mostly been studied individually. However, cross-cultural studies allow us to extrapolate forager-wide trends in how, when, and from whom hunter-gatherer children learn their subsistence skills. We perform a meta-ethnography, which allows us to systematically extract, summarize, and compare both quantitative and qualitative literature. We found 58 publications focusing on learning subsistence skills. Learning begins early in infancy, when parents take children on foraging expeditions and give them toy versions of tools. In early and middle childhood, children transition into the multi-age playgroup, where they learn skills through play, observation, and participation. By the end of middle childhood, most children are proficient food collectors. However, it is not until adolescence that adults (not necessarily parents) begin directly teaching children complex skills such as hunting and complex tool manufacture. Adolescents seek to learn innovations from adults, but they themselves do not innovate. These findings support predictive models that find social learning should occur before individual learning. Furthermore, these results show that teaching does indeed exist in hunter-gatherer societies. And, finally, though children are competent foragers by late childhood, learning to extract more complex resources, such as hunting large game, takes a lifetime.},

Another important theme is the performance level expected of the child. In farming societies, children as young as seven may put in a “full day’s work.” In a society dependent on hunting and gathering, children’s work is still mixed with play. One of the most common chores, especially for girls, is caring for younger siblings. This is a welcome assignment as girls appreciate the opportunity to be “little mothers.”},

To explain rapid juvenile growth, in this paper we consider girls’ activity levels and energy expended in subsistence effort. Results show that Pumé girls spend far less time in subsistence tasks in proportion to their body size compared with adults, and they have lower physical activity levels compared with many juveniles cross-culturally. Low activity levels help to explain where the extra energy comes from to support rapid growth in a challenging environment. We suggest that activity levels are important to account for the variation of resource and labor transfers in mediating energy availability.},

This paper examines foraging success among Inuit hunters, paying particular attention to factors that account for differential returns in hunting. Although there are several possibilities for explaining hunting success, this study finds that birth order and age are important predictors of foraging returns. Furthermore, data on food sharing suggests that birth order has important effects on the distribution of food. That is, early-born hunters not only produce more food, they give much of that food to their parents, who then distribute it to the hunter’s younger siblings. These findings are discussed within the context of local resource enhancement and the value of early-born sons to Inuit parents.},

	abstract = {The project presented in this dissertation investigates how children’s investments in food- and other resource-seeking behaviors external to the household influence their
dietary quality. The three articles represent aspects of the same issue concerning children’s ability to function in a marginal urban environment. I document child foraging in an urban environment, measuring and describing children’s foraging activities. Urban children forage without adult supervision and in groups. Both boys and girls forage, but boys allocate more time to foraging, and girls were more frequently engaged in sibling care activities. Urban children share foraged food with their household and with siblings and peers. Children contribute to the household by engaging in childcare, housework, provisioning activities (including foraging, working for food or money and begging). Children’s monetary contributions to the household are many times their own food budget (if calculate household food budget by number of people in the household). I test the idea that children’s food- and other resource-seeking behaviors might make a difference to their nutritional wellbeing under the extremely marginal conditions associated with urban poverty in many developing world regions. However, provisioning status was not associated with variation in either longer-run (height-for-age) or shorter run (weight-for-age) nutritional status. A comparison of provisioning and non- provisioning children showed that they had similar mean weight for age z-scores and mean height for age z-scores. Both foraging and other provisioning failed to predict the presence of anemia in children. The hypothesis that provisioning status will not greatly affect anthropometric markers of generalized caloric and protein sufficiency was supported. There was no significant difference between groups for any measures of dietary quality (including Dietary Diversity Score, Food Variety Score and caloric intake).},

Considerable variation in growth exists among hunter-gatherers that overlaps heavily with growth trajectories present in groups focusing more on horticulture. Intergroup variation tends to track environmental conditions, with societies under more favorable conditions displaying faster growth and earlier puberty. In addition, faster/earlier development in females is correlated with higher mortality. For example, African ‘‘Pygmies,’’ Philippine ‘‘Negritos,’’ and the Hiwi of Venezuela are characterized by relatively fast child-juvenile growth for their adult body size (used as a proxy for energetic availability). In these societies, subadult survival is low, and puberty, menarche, and ﬁrst reproduction are relatively early (given their adult body size), suggesting selective pressure for accelerated development in the face of higher mortality. In sum, the origin and maintenance of different human ontogenies may require explanations invoking both environmental constraints and selective pressures. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 18:295–311, 2006.

This paper addresses the effects of progressive incorporation into a wage-labor economy on the benefits of traditional kin networks for two social classes in urban South India. Predictions regarding the effects of kin network wealth, education, and size on child and spouse characteristics and methods of financing marriages are tested using various regression techniques. Despite the rapid growth of participation in a wage-labor economy, it is found that kin network characteristics still have an important impact on investment behavior among families in Bangalore in both social classes. Network wealth is found to have a positive effect on child and spouse characteristics, and large networks are found to act as significant drains on family resources. However, the results for education are broadly consistent with an interpretation of increasing family autonomy as parents’ education has a far stronger influence on child and spouse characteristics across categories than network education does. Finally, professional-class parents are found to prefer financing marriages using formal mechanisms such as savings and bank loans while working-class parents preferentially finance marriages using credit from relatives and friends.},

In this age range, hunting efficiency increases with age. In terms of weight of animals killed per hunting time, the efficiency of the elder married (aged about 35 to 45years) was almost four times higher than that of the unmarried (16-17 to late 20s). This aging effect is judged to depend on behavioral abilities that increase in accordance with experience and cumulative knowledge. Simultaneously, the comparison of individual hunters’ records in 1971-72 and in 1981 reveals that hunting efficiency is associated with the individualities of the hunters.},

That variation is of interest because it shapes the age range of children reliant on others for support and the age range of children available to help out, which in turn affects the competing demands on parents to support multiple dependents of different ages. The age at positive net production is used as a proxy to estimate the close of juvenile economic dependence among a group of Maya subsistence agriculturalists. Maya children produce more than they consume by their early to mid teens but remain in their natal households for a number of years before leaving home and beginning families of their own. The Maya results contrast markedly with those from several groups of hunter-gatherers and horticulturalists for whom we have similar data. Even in the Maya case, where children are self-sufficient at a relatively young age, parents are unable to support their children without help from others. The production surplus of older children appears to help underwrite the cost of large Maya families and subsidize their parents’ continued reproduction.},

Models incorporating individual costs and benefits of resource allocation, conflicts of interests between men and women and between parents and offspring, and the effects of family composition, subsistence ecology, and gender are developed and applied to data on time allocation, household demography, and household economy. Several findings emerged: (1) The availability of alternative productive tasks strongly affects intra- and intergenerational labor substitution. (2) The presence of similarly aged children of the same sex within the household decreases the likelihood of both boys and girls engaging in a specific productive activity and increases the likelihood of childrenÕs school attendance. (3) Birth order, the labor needs of the household, and parentsÕ marital status all affect school attendance. These results have implications for understanding the determinants of childrenÕs time allocation to labor and schooling and consequent impacts on development, health, and welfare. Am. J. Hum.

	abstract = {Hadza hunter-gatherers display economic and social features usually
assumed to indicate the dependence of wives and children
on provisioning husbands and fathers. The wives and children of
better Hadza hunters have been found to be better-nourished,
consistent with the assumption that men hunt to provision their
families. Yet, as is common among foragers, the Hadza share
meat widely. Analyses of meat-sharing data confirm that little of
the meat from large prey went to the hunter’s own household.
These analyses also show that neither a man’s hunting success
nor the time he spent hunting made any difference in how much
meat his family got from the kills of others. Here we address
questions posed by this set of observations. What explains the
better nutrition of the children of better hunters if they did not
get differential rations of meat? If better hunters got no more
meat for their effort and poorer hunters were not punished with
less, what incentive could account for the continuing disproportionate
contribution that some men made to the group’s nutrition?
If women were not dependent on their husband’s hunting
success for meat, an obvious incentive for women to marry
hunters disappears. We briefly consider the implications of these
patterns for the evolution of marriage and nuclear families.},

	title = {Evolutionary hypotheses for human childhood},
	volume = {40},
	abstract = {The origins of human childhood have fascinated scholars from many disciplines. Some researchers argue that childhood, and many other human characteristics, evolved by heterochrony, an evolutionary process that alters the timing of growth stages from ancestors to their descendants. Other scholars argue against heterochrony, but so far have not offered a well-developed alternative hypothesis. This essay presents such an alternative. Childhood is deﬁned as a unique developmental stage of humans. Childhood is the period following infancy, when the youngster is weaned from nursing but still depends on older people for feeding and protection. The biological constraints of childhood, which include an immature dentition, a small digestive system, and a calorie-demanding brain that is both relatively large and growing rapidly, necessitate the care and feeding that older individuals must provide. Evidence is presented that childhood evolved as a new stage hominid life history, ﬁrst appearing, perhaps, during the time of Homo habilis. The value of childhood is often ascribed to learning many aspects of human culture. It is certainly true that childhood provides ‘‘extra’’ time for brain development and learning. However, the initial selective value of childhood may be more closely related to parental strategies to increase reproductive success. Childhood allows a woman to give birth to new offspring and provide care for existing dependent young. Understanding the nature of childhood helps to explain why humans have lengthy development and low fertility, but greater reproductive success than any other species.

The first is the timing of life events, including development, reproduction, and aging. Second is the regulation of reproductive rates and its relationship to parental investment. Sexual dimorphism and its relationship to mating systems together are the third theme. Each of these themes is addressed from two perspectives: first, in a comparative cross-species context, and second, in terms of variation within and among human groups. Our primary goal is to introduce a new ecological framework for understanding variations in each of those domains and then to apply the framework to understanding both the special characteristics of our species in a comparative perspective and variations within and among human groups. A secondary goal is to discuss how evolutionary biology can be integrated with more traditional approaches to human demography and the new research questions such integration would generate},

	volume = {101},
	abstract = {This paper has two interrelated goals. The first is to offer a general theory of fertility and parental investment across a broad spectrum of human societies. The second is to provide a perspective that unifies traditionally separate domains of anthropology. The basic foundation for the analysis is life history theory and evolutionary biological models of optimal fertility regulation. This tradition is combined with human capital theory in economics to produce a more general theory of investments in embodied capital within and between generations. This synthesis results in a series of optimality models to examine the decision processes underlying fertility and parental investment upon which natural selection is expected to act. Those models are then applied to the hunting and gathering lifeway. This analysis focuses both on problems that all hunting and gathering peoples face and on the production of variable responses in relation to variable ecologies. Next, this consideration of optimal parental investment and fertility behavior in hunter‐gatherers is united with existing models of the proximate determinants of human fertility. The analysis of proximate mechanisms is based on the idea that natural selection acts on the final phenotypic outcome of a coordinated system of physiological, psychological and cultural processes. The important conditions affecting parental investment and fertility in modern socioeconomic contexts are then discussed. An explanation of modern fertility and parental investment behavior in terms of the interaction of those conditions with the physiological and psychological mechanisms that evolved during our hunting and gathering history is proposed. The proposal is that skills‐based competitive labor markets increase the value of parental investment in children and motivate better‐educated, higher income parents to invest more per child than their less‐educated, lower‐earning counterparts. It is also suggested that the deviation from fitness maximization associated with low modern fertility is due to excess expenditures on both parental and offspring consumption, indicating that our evolved psychology is responding to cues in the modern environment that are not directly related to the fitness impacts of consumption},

Industrialization and schooling are linked to dramatic declines in time spent on household and wage labor.

Adolescents in East Asian postindustrial societies spend this freed-up time in schoolwork, a use associated with lower intrinsic motivation but high achievement and economic productivity. Adolescents in North America spend more time in leisure, associated with greater self-direction but of an uncertain relation to development.

A comparison of children's socialization, training, and inculcation into cultural traditions in two communities is performed. The mechanisms of cultural change as mediated by children's levels of skills for traditional activities and their level of traditional knowledge of their environment are explored using a theoretical perspective derived from both economics and behavioral ecology.

	abstract = {Even though female food acquisition is an area of considerable interest in hunter-gatherer research, the ecological determinants of women’s economic decisions in these populations are still poorly understood. The literature on female foraging behavior indicates that there is considerable variation within and across foraging societies in the amount of time that women spend foraging and in the amount and types of food that they acquire. It is possible that this heterogeneity reflects variation in the trade-offs between time spent in food acquisition and child care activities that women face in different groups of hunter-gatherers. In this paper we discuss the fitness trade-offs between food acquisition and child care that Hiwi and Ache women foragers might face. Multiple regression analyses show that in both populations the daily food acquisition of a woman’s spouse is negatively related to female foraging effort. In addition, nursing mothers spend less time foraging and acquire less food than do nonnursing women. As the number of dependents that a woman has increases, however, women also increase foraging time and the amount of food they acquire. Some interesting exceptions to these general trends are as follows: (a) differences in foraging effort between nursing and nonnursing women are less pronounced when fruits and roots are in season than in other seasons of the year; (b) foraging return rates decrease for Ache women as their numbers of dependents increase; and (c) among Ache women, the positive effect of number of dependents on foraging behavior is less pronounced when fruits are in season than at other times of the year. Lastly, in the Hiwi sample we found that postreproductive women work considerably harder than women of reproductive age in the root season but not in other seasons of the year. We discuss how ecological variation in constraints, the number of health insults to children that Hiwi and Ache mothers can avoid, and the fitness benefits they can gain from spending time in food acquisition and child care might account for differences and similarities in the foraging behaviors of subgroups of Hiwi and Ache mothers across different seasons of the year. Valid tests of the explanations we propose will require considerable effort to measure the relationship between maternal food acquisition, child care, and adverse health outcomes in offspring.},

Cultural evolution theory predicts which social learning biases we expect people to use, but much less often when—during a person's life cycle— different social learning biases will be used. By measuring knowledge and skill variation among age cohorts, it is possible to infer how people socially acquire different types of knowledge at different ages. We use this strategy among the Jenu Kuruba, a tribal community in South India. We document the accumulation of local knowledge required for collecting wild honey among 71 children and 125 adults from five communities. Combining quantitative measurements of knowledge with measures of four honey-collecting skills and self-reported data on learning age, we infer patterns of social learning across the lifecycle. We find that (1) most knowledge related to honey collecting is acquired by the early 20s, and later social learning mainly functions to update information; (2) the eldest cohort has the highest average explicit knowledge, although the most knowledgeable or skilled individuals do not always belong to the most elderly cohort; (3) length of learning can be affected by age-dependent trade-offs of costs and benefits to learners; and (4) children tend to learn from parents, but individuals use other demonstrators later in life.

Food sharing has been widely held to be a fundamental feature of the hunting and gathering way of life and has been hypothesized to have played a major role in the evolution of language, intelligence, and the sexual division of labor. The very general question that guided the research is: What factors are responsible for the evolution of food sharing among adult conspecifics, and how can we account for the variation among groups in the extent to which food is shared? Five alternative hypotheses concerning the evolution of adult-adult food sharing are reviewed and analyzed in terms of the competing predictions they generate. These hypotheses invoke (1) kin selection, (2) tolerated theft, (3) temporal reciprocity, (4) cooperative acquisition of food resources, and (5) conservation of resources. For meat and honey, the resources the Ache share most, the data conform to the predictions of the tolerated-theft and temporal-reciprocity hypotheses, with some qualifications. Long-term differences in productivity between foragers suggest that reciprocity is not completely balanced. The implications of these results for a general theory of food sharing are discussed.},

	shorttitle = {Hunter-gatherer {Childhoods}},
	abstract = {In the vast anthropological literature devoted to hunter-gatherer societies, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the place of hunter-gatherer children. Children often represent 40 percent of hunter-gatherer populations, thus nearly half the population is omitted from most hunter-gatherer ethnographies and research. This volume is designed to bridge the gap in our understanding of the daily lives, knowledge, and development of hunter-gatherer children.The twenty-six contributors to Hunter-Gatherer Childhoods use three general but complementary theoretical approaches--evolutionary, developmental, cultural--in their presentations of new and insightful ethnographic data. For instance, the authors employ these theoretical orientations to provide the first systematic studies of hunter-gatherer children\&\#39;s hunting, play, infant care by children, weaning and expressions of grief. The chapters focus on understanding the daily life experiences of children, and their views and feelings about their lives and cultural change. Chapters address some of the following questions: why does childhood exist, who cares for hunter-gatherer children, what are the characteristic features of hunter-gatherer children\&\#39;s development and what are the impacts of culture change on hunter-gatherer child care? The book is divided into five parts. The first section provides historical, theoretical and conceptual framework for the volume; the second section examines data to test competing hypotheses regarding why childhood is particularly long in humans; the third section expands on the second section by looking at who cares for hunter-gatherer children; the fourth section explores several developmental issues such as weaning, play and loss of loved ones; and, the final section examines the impact of sedentism and schools on hunter-gatherer children. This pioneering volume will help to stimulate further research and scholarship on hunter-gatherer childhoods, thereby advancing our understanding of the way of life that characterized most of human history and of the processes that may have shaped both human development and human evolution.Barry S.

	abstract = {Humans sometimes forage or distribute the products of foraging in ways that do not maximize individual energetic return rates. As an alternative to hypotheses that rely on reciprocal altruism to counter the costs of inefficiency, we suggest that the cost itself could be recouped through signal benefit. Costly signaling theory predicts that signals can provide fitness benefits when costs are honestly linked to signaler quality, and this information is broadcast to potential mates and competitors. Here, we test some predictions of costly signaling theory against empirical data on human food acquisition and sharing patterns. We show that at least two types of marine foraging, turtle hunting and spearfishing, as practiced among the Meriam (a Melanesian people of Torres Strait, Australia) meet key criteria for costly signaling: signal traits are (1) differentially costly or beneficial in ways that are (2) honestly linked to signaler quality, and (3) designed to effectively broadcast the signal. We conclude that relatively inefficient hunting or sharing choices may be maintained in a population if they serve as costly and reliable signals designed to reveal the signaler's qualities to observers.},

While this statement is generally applicable, it carries particular force when our concern is with emotional behaviour. Which of us has not felt, in moments of great emotion, that his behaviour and his feelings are due to forces of which he has little understanding and over which he has still less control? If we are ever to achieve such understanding—and only understanding will bring control—it is essential that we subject our behaviour, and the behaviour of our animal relatives, to the same kind of systematic observation and experiment which has paid such huge dividends in the physical sciences.
In carrying out such a programme of scientific research, there are, broadly speaking, two kinds of approach one can adopt. One can consider the historical origins of the behaviour Man displays today, or one can investigate the actual organisation of this behaviour. . . . In this book, we shall adopt both approaches, often simultaneously; but, by and large, the first half of the book (up to chapter 8) is more concerned with the origins, both phylogenetic (affecting the evolution of the species) and ontogenetic (affecting the development of the individual), of fearful behaviour, and the second half is more concerned with its organisation.

Investigating the impact of inherited-wealth status â€“ an accident of birth rather than an outcome of competition â€“ contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying intergenerational inequality. This lab experiment analyses whether framed inherited endowments influence real-effort task performance. In particular, the analysis concerns the interaction between a framed inherited status in the lab and participantsâ€™ real intergenerational wealth status outside the lab. The results indicate that inheritance-framed endowments trigger a race gap (in favor of non-black participants) but identity-neutral lottery-framed endowments do not. Inheritance framing in the lab appears to trigger significant changes in behavior for Princes (participants that expect to inherit wealth from their parents) while opposite but non-significant effects are found for Paupers (who do not expect to inherit wealth from their parents).},

Given that childhood is argued to be the time when other-regarding preferences and egalitarianism develop, it is critical to evaluate how the development of food sharing may influence prosociality. In this chapter, the social processes of learning to share food among Hadza hunter-gatherer children are explored. I combine naturalistic observations of food sharing, experimental data on other-regarding preferences, and ethnographic interview data to determine processes of cultural transmission. The results suggest that Hadza children routinely share food with both related and unrelated partners, although preferentially share with kin. They exhibit many processes of social learning, including observation, imitation, participation, reinforcement, play, and teaching. These data support recent suggestions that prosociality and egalitarianism develop strongly during middle childhood when children acquire the normative rules of their society.},

Thus, understanding the adaptive nature of culture is crucial to understand human evolution. We use a cross-cultural framework and empirical data purposely collected to test whether culturally transmitted and individually appropriated knowledge provides individual returns in terms of hunting yields and health and, by extension, to nutritional status, a proxy for individual adaptive success. Data were collected in three subsistence-oriented societies: the Tsimane’ (Amazon), the Baka (Congo Basin), and the Punan (Borneo). Results suggest that variations in individual levels of local environmental knowledge relate to individual hunting returns and to self-reported health, but not to nutritional status. We argue that this paradox can be explained through the prevalence of sharing: individuals achieving higher returns to their knowledge transfer them to the rest of the population, which explains the lack of association between knowledge and nutritional status. The finding is in consonance with previous research highlighting the importance of cultural traits favoring group success, but pushes it forward by elucidating the mechanisms through which individual and group level adaptive forces interact.},

The size and composition of cooperative groups can be understood as a self-organized outcome of these choices, which are made under local ecological and social constraints. This article describes a theoretical framework for explaining the size and composition of foraging groups based on three principles: (i) the sexual division of labour; (ii) the intergenerational division of labour; and (iii) economies of scale in production. We test predictions from the theory with data from two field contexts: Tsimane' game hunters of lowland Bolivia, and Jenu Kuruba honey collectors of South India. In each case, we estimate the impacts of group size and individual group members' effort on group success. We characterize differences in the skill requirements of different foraging activities and show that individuals participate more frequently in activities in which they are more efficient. We evaluate returns to scale across different resource types and observe higher returns at larger group sizes in foraging activities (such as hunting large game) that benefit from coordinated and complementary roles. These results inform us that the foraging group size and composition are guided by the motivated choice of individuals on the basis of relative efficiency, benefits of cooperation, opportunity costs and other social considerations.},

Hadza hunters disregard small prey in favour of larger forms (mean adult mass {\textasciicircum} 40 kg) . Here we report experimental data showing that hunters would.reduce their mean rates if they included small animals in the array they target. Still, daily variance in large animal hunting returns is high, and the risk of failure correspondingly great, significantly greater than that associated with small game hunting and trapping. Sharing large kills reduces the risk of meatless days for big game hunters, and obviates the problem of storing large amounts of meat. It may be unavoidable if large carcasses cannot be defended economically against the demands of other consumers. If so, then large prey are common goods. A hunter may gain no consumption advantage from his own big game acquisition efforts. We use Hadza data to model this ‘collective action’ problem, and find that an exclusive focus on large game with extensive sharing is not the optimal strategy for hunters concerned with maximizing their own chances of eating meat. Other explanations for the .emergence and persistence of this practice must be considered.},

Using incentivized economic games, we report on sex differences in risk preferences in the Hadza, a population of hunter-gatherers. One game played in 2010 (n = 233) found that more Hadza males than females prefer to gamble for a chance to earn more maize rather than settle for a sure, but smaller, amount. Similarly, a second game played in 2013 (n = 102) found that male Hadza gamble a greater proportion of honey for a chance to earn more compared to female Hadza. Effect sizes are small to medium. We ﬁnd weak evidence that risk-taking increases in men as their mating opportunities increase. In both games, the sex difference widens throughout childhood and is greatest among adolescents; though note that child samples are small. We explore developmental trends further using observational data on food returns in children (n = 357). Our data suggest that while the mean number of calories boys bring to camp remains stable with age, the variance in their caloric returns increases. Among girls, the variance remains stable with increased age. Both the economic games and food return data are consistent with the sexual division of labor wherein boys, beginning in late childhood, begin to target riskier foods. To the extent that the Hadza allow us to make inferences about long-standing patterns of human behavior, we suggest that sex differences in risk preferences may have been present long before agriculture and the modern work environment.},

Here we introduce a mixed longitudinal/cross-sectional dataset based on 45 years of research with the Batek, a population of egalitarian rain forest hunter-gatherers in Peninsular Malaysia, and use it to test the effects of four predictors of lifetime reproductive success: (i) foraging return rate, (ii) sharing proclivity, (iii) cooperative foraging tendency, and (iv) kin presence. We found that none of these factors can explain variation in lifetime reproduction among males or females. We suggest that social egalitarianism, combined with strikingly low infant and juvenile mortality rates, can mediate the pathway between foraging, status-accruing behavior, and reproductive success.

In terms of weight of animals killed per hunting time, the efficiency of the elder married (aged about 35 to 45years) was almost four times higher than that of the unmarried (16-17 to late 20s). This aging effect is judged to depend on behavioral abilities that increase in accordance with experience and cumulative knowledge. Simultaneously, the comparison of individual hunters’ records in 1971-72 and in 1981 reveals that hunting efficiency is associated with the individualities of the hunters.},

With two exceptions (the essays by Brown and Eldredge), all of the present essays were originally presented at the Fifth Biannual Symposium on the Science of Behavior held in Guadalajara, Mexico, in February 1998. The volume opens with the problem of the origins of culture, tackled from two different viewpoints by Richerson and Boyd, and Lancaster, Kaplan, Hill, and Hurtado, respectively. Richerson and Boyd analyze the possible relations between climatic change in the Pleistocene and the evo lution of social learning, evaluating the boundary conditions under which social learning could increase fitness and contribute to culture. Lancaster, Kaplan, Hill, and Hurtado examine how a shift in the diet of the genus Homo toward difficult-to-acquire food could have determined (or coe volved with) unique features of the human life cycle. These two essays illus trate how techniques that range from computer modeling to comparative behavioral analysis, and that make use of a wide range of data, can be used for drawing inferences about past selection pressures. As culture evolves, it must somehow find its place within (and also affect) a complex hierarchy of behavioral and biological factors.},

GPS log tracks were obtained from all 44 children, and acceleration monitoring were performed for 21 children each for consecutive 3 days. Baka children showed a generally high level of physical activity. They walked more than 20,000 steps per day (boys: 25,331 ± 9,348, girls: 22,400 ± 4,258), and the mean of their estimated PALs (boys: 2.08 ± 0.21, girls: 2.10 ± 0.15) were classified “vigorous.” Total travel distances and active radii were become significantly greater as their age increased, and a dispersion was appeared in older boys. The sex-/age- difference for daily time-space using were observed from GPS log data, moreover, it was considered that boys changed their daily lives greater than girls as they grew up. In addition, it was suggested that activities outside of their own village were related to increasing children’s physical activities.},

Height and weight of 626 Baka children in southeast Cameroon were measured. The nutritional status was assessed using body mass index (BMI), and the Preece-Baines function was adopted for obtaining height velocity curve and assessing growth pattern. More than 80 \% participants had BMI in the normal range, and their nutritional status was considered generally good. The height velocity curves and biological parameters indicated that their adolescent growth spurts were very week. However, the periods of adolescent growth spurt of Baka children were almost similar to those of previously studied five groups. Furthermore, their growth rate during the early childhood was suggested to be very slow. The periods of childhood were the same among the modern human populations. However, a great difference was observed in the linear growth rate between the Baka and other populations.},

This theory should be compatible with the physiological evidence that ageing is largely due to deterioration, which is, in principle, reversible through repair. Moreover, this theory should also explain why natural selection has favoured organisms that first improve with age (mortality rates decrease) and then deteriorate with age (mortality rates rise). We present a candidate for such a theory of life history, applied initially to a species with determinate growth. The model features both the quantity and the quality of somatic capital, where it is optimal to initially build up quantity, but to allow quality to deteriorate. The main theoretical result of the paper is that a life history where mortality decreases early in life and then increases late in life is evolutionarily optimal. In order to apply the model to humans, in particular, we include a budget constraint to allow intergenerational transfers. The resultant theory then accounts for all our basic demographic characteristics, including menopause with extended survival after reproduction has ceased.},

Kelly reviews the anthropological literature for variation among living foragers in terms of diet, mobility, sharing, land tenure, technology, exchange, male-female relations, division of labor, marriage, descent, and political organization. Using the paradigm of human behavioral ecology, he analyzes the diversity in these areas and seeks to explain rather than explain away variability, and argues for an approach to prehistory that uses archaeological data to test theory rather than one that uses ethnographic analogy to reconstruct the past.},

Understanding why this advanced social cognition evolved benefits from an understanding of the kind of social organisation that is promoted by hunting-and-gathering, the dominant mode of subsistence throughout most of human evolutionary history. In this thesis, I explore the social organisation of hunter-gatherers in general and of the Palanan Agta in particular. In chapter four, I present data that demonstrate that, like many small-scale hunter-gatherer societies, the Agta live in small groups of fluid composition in which a large number of unrelated individuals co-reside. I present the results of a model that simulates the process of camp assortment and which suggests that sex equality in residential decision making may serve to constrain group relatedness. In chapter five, I challenge traditional biological conceptions of relatedness, arguing that under conditions of stable pair-bonding, individuals can derive inclusive fitness benefits through aiding affinal kin. In chapter six, I explore multilevel social organisation among the Agta and argue that it serves to provide individuals with access to the range of social relationships required to overcome both short-term variability in foraging returns and long-term energetic deficits resulting from the demands of having an energetically expensive life-history strategy.},

influences the dynamics of fitness conflict within the family nucleus, but it also interacts
with environment’s ecology through its dependence on resources. The problem of why
this trait should take different forms within the same species has been the subject of a
longstanding debate. Here, I will present a theoretical simulation study modelling the
emergence of post-marital residence strategies (PMRS), whose results show how
reproductive cost and offspring investment are drivers of sex-biased dispersal. The
mechanism described represents an underlying factor to strategy evolution, in-built in
human life-history, with which other ecological aspects are likely to interact. This outcome
places the two factors mentioned at the centre of the discussion on strategy emergence.
To attempt an empirical investigation of sex differences in offspring investment, I will
present a fieldwork study conducted among a Chinese ethnic minority, the Mosuo, in
which members of a married couple reside separately, each with their matrilineal kin. This
study consists in a series of exploratory analyses of labour effort allocation and is aimed
at addressing the problem of male contribution to household subsistence (here seen as
a form of family investment). My perspective, as formed from the results, is of the
emergence of different strategies as (also) resulting from the unstable balances reached
in the conflict for reproductive investment between the sexes},

in order to construct a hypothetical life history of the last common ancestor of
all great apes and to identify features of human life history that have been
derived during the evolution of our lineage. Data compiled from the published
literature indicate some variation across the living taxa, but all great apes
have relatively long lifespans and late maturity. Therefore, we infer that a
slow life history is the ancestral state of all great apes.
We examine variation in the timing of brain growth and aspects of dental development and find that they are not correlated in the life history variation across these species. We conclude that adjustment in growth and
development, though constrained by life history, are imperfect predictors of life
history variables.
Our comparisons show that humans have the slowest life history of the
great apes, with a notably longer adult lifespan and an older age at first birth.
We investigate the two important features of human life history that deviate
from the expected great ape pattern: shortened interbirth intervals and vigorous postmenopausal longevity. Human infants are weaned earlier thanexpected for their age at maturity and before they are capable of independent
feeding. Because females conceive soon after weaning an infant, women
typically have multiple dependent offspring simultaneously. The pattern of
human age-related fertility decline appears to be conserved. Reproductive
senescence occurs at essentially the same age among all great apes, suggesting
that the marked postmenopausal survival of human females is a derived trait
resulting from selection for slower rates of somatic aging. The human pattern
of shortened interbirth intervals and “stacking” dependents could have
evolved only if human mothers had reliable sources of help. Related postmenopausal and pre reproductive females, without infants of their own, likely
gained inclusive fitness benefits from supplying that help.},

uncertainty. The fact that Homo sapiens is characterized by high levels of both cooperative sociality and adiposity

	abstract = {Humans experience lower extrinsic mortality than other hominoids. This fact may underlie
the evolution of long human lifespan, delayed maturity, exceptional intelligence, and intra and
intergenerational resource transfers. Understanding why humans have low mortality is therefore
critical for understanding basic human traits. One explanation is that the evolution of food
provisioning to individuals suffering health crises reduced mortality. This brings up the questions of
whether selection produced adaptations for producing or eliciting this behavior, and what functional
attributes those adaptations are expected to embody. Health risk is hypothesized to have selected for
adaptations motivating individuals to generously and recurrently provide beneficial goods and/or
services to others, because this had the effect of motivating the recipients to provide costly health
care to their provider when s/he was sick or injured. Conversely, adaptations motivating individuals
to value those who generously and recurrently provide them with important benefits such that the
former are willing to provide costly care when a valued person is disabled have been put forth. These
hypotheses are contingent upon health risk having constituted a significant and specific kind of
selection pressure for our ancestors, and health-care provisioning having significantly reduced
mortality and increased fitness. Evidence of such selection pressure may be searched for in the fossil
record and among extant forager populations. Here I report the causes, distribution, and duration of
injuries and illnesses suffered by Shiwiar forager-horticulturalists based on physical evidence and
informant reports. I find that (a) most individuals suffer pathology during their lifetimes that would
be lethal without help from others, (b) these periods are temporally unpredictable (c) not primarily
attributable to impacts from the Western/Industrial world and (d) the fitness effects of surviving
these episodes are high, suggesting that selection could favor adaptations motivating individuals to
the pay long term costs associated with maintaining relationships that yield health care altruism.},

While the continental record as a whole suggests that human populations were very low from initial colonization through early Holocene, coastal and peri-coastal sites dating to that time are dominated by small, low-ranked, littoral taxa to the near-complete exclusion of large, higher ranked, sub-littoral species, precisely the opposite of theory-based expectations, if human populations and predation rates were indeed as low as other data suggest. We present a model of shellfish exploitation combining information on species utility, transport considerations, and prey life-history that might account for this apparent mismatch, and then assess it with ethnographic and archaeological data. Findings suggest either that high-ranked taxa were uncommon along the Pleistocene coastlines of Sahul, or that abundant and commonly taken high-ranked prey are under-represented in middens relative to their role in human diets largely as a function of human processing and transport practices. If the latter reading is correct, archaeological evidence of early shellfishing may be mainly the product of subsistence activities by children and their mothers.},

subsistence interests between men and women. For example, earlier studies of Carson Desert prehistory suggest a semisedentary, gathering strategy replaced a mobile, hunting-oriented strategy in response to diminishing densities of large
game. This implies that the influence of men s and women s work effort on residential location and mobility changed,
but assumes both genders foraged for the common good rather than striving for different goals. A new central place
foraging model based on a human behavioral ecology perspective of sexual division of labor considers how men and
women might reconcile conflicting foraging interests given likely resource abundance, return rates, and transport costs.
Men s hunting returns must be high enough to reliably provision children for a hunting-oriented settlement pattern to
occur. Otherwise, men should logistically hunt out of bases positioned to facilitate women s foraging. Therefore, a
hunting-oriented strategy seems unlikely in the Late Holocene Carson Desert},

	shorttitle = {Foraging variability in the prehistoric {Caribbean}},
	abstract = {This research assesses the zooarchaeological evidence for variable foraging strategies at two matched Caribbean sites, Sabazan and Grand Bay, on the Grenadine Island of Carriacou during the Late Ceramic Age, ca. AD 400 – 1400. Using human behavioral ecology and foraging theory, I investigate whether foraging adaptations differ between sites in a context where the culture, environmental structure, and settlement history of the study locals correspond strongly to each other. This parity of comparison permits me to evaluate whether multiple, optimally adaptive foraging solutions (multiple foraging optima) may exist under the same set of cultural, ecological, and chronological constraints. In addition, I consider the potential for disparate foraging optima to differentially influence the course of future adaptations at each site and
resulting human impacts on the environment by examining long-term patterns of resource use and evidence for anthropogenic exploitation depression.
Results indicate strong correspondences between the sites in taxonomic composition, major prey species and habitats targeted, the introduction of continental mammals, and intensified exploitation of molluscan resources over time. At both sites, resource use appears to have been sustainable over a millennium of occupation. Significant zooarchaeological differences between sites were also identified, namely the presence of a well-developed pelagic tuna fishery at Sabazan and a comparatively greater emphasis on inshore/shallow water fishing at Grand Bay. Rather than support the existence of multiple foraging optima, however, these disparities in resource use are better attributed to modest differences in local environmental structure. These findings underscore the way in which seemingly minor foraging constraints may shape behavioral adaptations and the importance of incorporating such considerations into analytic models. Moreover, they illustrate that the ecological effects of human foraging in the past are variable and cannot be universally assumed to have been detrimental, even for small island ecosystems. It is hoped that by integrating into an explicit foraging theory framework the methods currently employed in Caribbean archaeology to understand resource exploitation and insular adaptation, this research will increase the predictive and explanatory power of such studies and open up additional avenues of research.},

	title = {Physical attractiveness: {An} adaptationist perspective},
	shorttitle = {Physical attractiveness},
	abstract = {The literature on human attractiveness spans the sciences, social sciences, and
humanities, and dates back at least to the time of Plato. Consequently, scholars across
the disciplines have proposed and investigated a variety of ideas about what makes
some people more or less attractive than others (e.g., Etcoff, 1999). Addressing this
vast literature from an adaptationist perspective is well beyond the scope of this
chapter. This chapter limits itself to (1) outlining an adaptationist perspective on physical
attractiveness, (2) presenting the basic questions that this perspective leads us to ask,
(3) reviewing some important empirical advances in the answering of these questions,
and (4) highlighting research avenues calling for increased attention. I argue that human
physical attractiveness assessment is generated by adaptations functioning to evaluate
evolutionarily relevant cues to human social value across multiple domains of
interaction (e.g., kin, mating, cooperation) and that evolutionary human life history
theory and data from small-scale foraging societies are instrumental in generating
predictions about these domains of social value and the cues associated with them.
Multiple, converging lines of evidence are, useful to test whether a given phenotypic trait
is an adaptation (e.g., Symons, 1989; Tooby \& Cosmides, 1990, 1992). In the case of
complex adaptations (e.g., immune systems, social exchange reasoning, or
attractiveness-assessment psychologies), the most compelling case is made when
there is evidence that: (1) the species in question recurrently faced a particular adaptive
problem during recent evolutionary history, (2) the structure in question has a complex
functional design that is so improbably well-suited to solving that adaptive problem that
we are forced to reject pure chance as an alternative hypothesis, and (3) the organism
in question shares with all normal conspecifics that design or a facultative
developmental program that builds that design.},

evolutionary importance of this behavioral characteristic is widely recognized, but the
steps by which members of our genus came to use fire and the timing of this behavioral
adaptation remain largely unknown. These issues are, in part, addressed in the
following pages, which are organized as three separate but interrelated papers.
The first paper, entitled “Beyond Firestick Farming: The Effects of Aboriginal
Burning on Economically Important Plant Foods in Australia’s Western Desert,”
examines the effect of landscape burning techniques employed by Martu Aboriginal
Australians on traditionally important plant foods in the arid Western Desert ecosystem.
The questions of how and why the relationship between landscape burning and plant
food exploitation evolved are also addressed and contextualized within prehistoric
demographic changes indicated by regional archaeological data.
In the second piece, “The Pyrophilic Primate Hypothesis,” recent
paleoenvironmental reconstructions and models from Optimal Foraging Theory are
used to construct an evolutionary scenario of human fire dependence during the Plio-
Pleistocene transition in Africa {\textasciitilde}2.5-2.0 million years ago. The foraging benefits
identified in this fire-altered habitat are linked to our evolutionary ancestors’
iv
transformation into a genus of active pyrophiles whose dependence on fire for survival
contributed to its expansion out of Africa.
The final paper, “On the Archaeological Signature of Human Fire Use: Analyses,
Interpretations, and Implications for Understanding the Evolution of Pyrotechnic
Behaviors,” reviews recent debates about the timing of anthropogenic fire based on
archaeological data. The efficacy of archaeological markers in constructing hypotheses
of prehistoric human fire use is assessed by comparing archaeological fire signatures, or
lack thereof, in Europe and North America.
Each paper constitutes one component of a broader intellectual goal: to show that
genus Homo is a primate adapted to and dependent upon fire for its survival and
reproduction. Our genus’ active pyrophilia is a unique trait, and it is hoped that the
following pages contribute to a better understanding of how, when, and why this trait
evolved.},

The physically active lifestyle of earlier human populations has been emphasized, especially the cardiovascular endurance component and energy expenditure, but less attention has been devoted to the gross and fine motor skills that are essential components of this lifestyle. Motor skills developed through practice are important determinants of success and survival in preindustrial societies. In industrial and postindustrial societies, on the other hand, the role of physical activity is different, with prowess in certain areas of physical expertise (e.g., accuracy with projectiles, muscular strength, among others) and prolonged exertion (i.e., cardiovascular endurance) less important for survival. The combined effects of the transition to a sedentary lifestyle and attendant dietary changes have resulted first an epidemic of coronary heart disease and more recently an epidemic of overweight/obesity in postindustrial societies. Although mortality associated with coronary heart disease has declined, due largely to biomedical advances, overweight and obesity have increased concomitantly with population reduction in physical activity (energy expenditure) and increased calorie (energy) consumption. The current scenario begs several questions which have implications for contemporary human biology related to sustaining the pace of cultural change on a biological base that is increasingly being compromised by physical inactivity, overweight, and obesity.},

	title = {Primate behavioral responses to burning as a model for hominin fire use},
	abstract = {Both anecdotes and systematic observations show that primates take advantage of burned landscapes. However, few studies have made these behaviors the focus of attention. This dissertation includes three papers documenting the behavioral responses of South African vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops) to seasonal burning. The first paper details changes in spatial behavior related to burning. In it, we review the behavioral responses of other primate populations to fire, and describe typical ranging behavior among vervets. We compare our results to other accounts of primate-fire related behavior and evaluate whether the changes observed are unique to this population or species, or whether they are indicative of a primate-wide phenomenon. The second paper outlines changes in foraging opportunities postburn. Here, I compare the postencounter energetic returns and encounter rates of primate prey items within burned and unburned conditions. I identify improvements where they exist, and explore the hypothesis that burned savanna habitats offer improved foraging returns. Finally, the third chapter explores how and why fire alters both the threat of predation and general risk. I review the general pattern of predation on primates, and investigate the tradeoffs involved in risk avoidance. I conclude that burning offers savanna-dwelling primates a safe-haven from many primary predators and threats. I end the dissertation with a fourth paper that employs conceptual tools from optimal foraging theory to generate, test, and refine expectations about the behavioral adaptations of hominins inhabiting fire-prone savanna biomes. Here, I use the primate data to construct a general theory of behavior for the origins of human fire use. I argue that the behavior of savanna-dwelling primates may serve as a basis for hypotheses regarding the origins of fire use in the hominin lineage. I highlight the distinction between passive and active fire use, and use these observations to suggest future realms of research investigating fire-related behavioral shifts and their effect on the human life history, hominin dispersals, and the adaptation of complex pyrotechnology.},

whether or not a species communicates symbolically when appropriately constrained

communication a listener can predict his own emotional state from that of
a speaker. If a speaker, having found food in one case and predators in another,
returned in a high positive state in one case and a high negative state in another,
listeners could venture forth and stay home respectively, in anticipation of objects
that would induce comparable affective states in them. The effect could be comparable
to that of the symbolic communication ‘there are apples out there’ and ‘there
is a tiger out there’. However, the affective system depends upon a precondition which
the symbolic one does not. A listener can predict his own affective state from that of
a speaker only if both parties have concordant preferences. Therefore, induce a
high need to communicate while at the same time destroying the normally concordant
preferences of the species; if the species still communicates it is symbol
positive. In addition, a model is presented suggesting that basic cause-effect relations,

	abstract = {The literature on human attractiveness spans the sciences, social sciences, and
humanities, and dates back at least to the time of Plato. Consequently, scholars across
the disciplines have proposed and investigated a variety of ideas about what makes
some people more or less attractive than others (e.g., Etcoff, 1999). Addressing this
vast literature from an adaptationist perspective is well beyond the scope of this
chapter. This chapter limits itself to (1) outlining an adaptationist perspective on physical
attractiveness, (2) presenting the basic questions that this perspective leads us to ask,
(3) reviewing some important empirical advances in the answering of these questions,
and (4) highlighting research avenues calling for increased attention. I argue that human
physical attractiveness assessment is generated by adaptations functioning to evaluate
evolutionarily relevant cues to human social value across multiple domains of
interaction (e.g., kin, mating, cooperation) and that evolutionary human life history
theory and data from small-scale foraging societies are instrumental in generating
predictions about these domains of social value and the cues associated with them.
Multiple, converging lines of evidence are, useful to test whether a given phenotypic trait
is an adaptation (e.g., Symons, 1989; Tooby \& Cosmides, 1990, 1992). In the case of
complex adaptations (e.g., immune systems, social exchange reasoning, or
attractiveness-assessment psychologies), the most compelling case is made when
there is evidence that: (1) the species in question recurrently faced a particular adaptive
problem during recent evolutionary history, (2) the structure in question has a complex
functional design that is so improbably well-suited to solving that adaptive problem that
we are forced to reject pure chance as an alternative hypothesis, and (3) the organism
in question shares with all normal conspecifics that design or a facultative
developmental program that builds that design.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity, or the ability to alter one’s
morphological, physiological, and behavior phenotype
in response to environmental change ( Pigliucci
2001 ), is central to organismal life histories.
Plasticity in reproductive physiologies and behaviors
in response to stochastic environmental signals
(i.e., diet, activity, stress, disease, availability of
mates) is hypothesized to represent a suite of complex
adaptations, reaction norms produced by natural
and sexual selection and constrained by
trade-offs under conditions of resource restriction
( Schlichting and Pigliucci 1998 , Sinervo and
Svensson 1998 ). This is to be expected given the
central role of reproduction in life history evolution.
Like other organisms described throughout
this volume, humans are required to allocate physiological
resources between reproduction and a
number of competing functions, particularly
growth and survivorship ( Stearns 1992 ). Humans
are capital breeding, iteroparous organisms that
budget time and stored energy over a number of
reproductive events within a lifetime.
Humans have unusual life history characteristics:
we are born helpless, take a long time to
mature, and can live for 70 years or more, including
a female post-reproductive period following
menopause ( Mace 2000 ). These life history traits
may be linked with our remarkable cognitive and
social abilities compared to other species: humans
have very large brains that have complex and
lengthy patterns of psychological development
( Geary 2005 ). The interactive development of
human life history traits may be understood by
considering the context in which they could have
evolved. Here we review both theory and mechanisms
of human life history evolution. We emphasize
the key endocrinological mediators of life
history trade-offs, particularly those involving
reproduction. Specifi c topics include reproductive
maturation, male and female reproductive ecologies,
mating/parental behaviors, and reproductive
senescence.},

	abstract = {The existence of individual differences in behavior is a well-documented but poorly understood phenomenon. On the one hand, individual variation could be attributable to nonadaptive evolutionary processes, such as genetic drift, or to stochastic environmental forces that act upon a single genotype to produce an array of observed behavioral phenotypes. On the other hand, behavioral differences may reflect the action of the process of natural selection on the form, degree, context, and origins of differences in behavior. The characteristics of behavioral variation in any given species may themselves represent an adaptation which increases individual success. The nonadaptive “explanation” is common, but generally untestable; it makes no specific predictions, although implicitly it suggests that many observed types will be maladaptive. The functional interpretation leads us to expect pattern in the occurrence of individual variation both between and within species such that an individual’s behavior is more precisely fit for its peculiar circumstances. In this chapter, we explicitly pursue the possibility of functional and adaptive individuality. We review the reports of variation in social and foraging behavior and consider the existing explanations for this variation. We then try to develop a framework for further study which relates the appearance and controls on individuality to the life history of an organism and the dynamics of its foraging and social environments. This framework leads to some specific predictions both interspecifically and intraspecifically.},

	shorttitle = {Patchiness and prosociality},
	abstract = {This dissertation begins with a comprehensive review of the evolutionary
biological debate over the evolution of altruism and a discussion of how various models
of mechanism have influenced the models of circumstance that paleoanthropologists
continue to use in reconstructing details about the level of cooperation displayed by early
hominin societies. The remainder of the dissertation concerns itself with systematically
exposing previously unquestioned assumptions to potential falsification as well as with
exploring some new scenarios concerning the evolution and landscape archaeology of
Plio-Pleistocene hominin food sharing, all via a null agent-based model called SHARE.
This heuristic model was built to address two major questions: (1) What range of
ecological and social conditions facilitates the evolution of food sharing in artificial Plio-
Pleistocene hominin populations and (2) Is food sharing at central places necessary for
the formation of the so-called “scatter and patches” archaeological landscapes that are
characteristic of the Plio-Pleistocene record in East Africa? In answer to the first
question, population-level genetic results collected from artificial societies of hominin
agents demonstrate that the so-called transitional zone of ecological patchiness can
facilitate the evolution of altruistic food sharing in mixed starting populations, even if
foragers lack the ability to remember past interactions or to avoid social cheaters. In
answer to the second question, ecological patchiness can affect the movements of simple
foragers such that the artificial archaeological landscapes they create display the same
spatial signature that characterizes observed Oldowan landscapes. That is, in ecological
conditions marked by fragmented food resources, archaeological landscapes composed of both concentrated patches and diffuse scatters can form as a result of solitary foragers
using simple routes that are in no way tethered to culturally-defined and culturallymaintained
central places. In the end, SHARE provides new hypotheses about how
ecological patchiness could have influenced both the evolution of altruistic food sharing
and the structure of Lower Paleolithic archaeological landscapes. The latter can be tested
in the field by looking at the relationship between artifact density and the
paleoenvironmental characteristics of locales both in which artifacts are abundant and
from which they are conspicuously absent.},

Currently, mitigation strategies fail to target the individuals responsible for initiating and maintaining this behavior. As primates mainly forage on crops in groups, we investigate the crop-foraging behavior of a group of 40 chacma baboons in Zimbabwe from the perspective of collective movements, i.e., when a group of animals move together in the same direction, thus resulting in a change of location. We collected data on 110 crop-foraging events during 35 days in March–April 2014. We recorded baboon movement and behavior with a camcorder and obtained further information through video analysis. Most crop-foraging events involved less than 20\% of the troop and lasted less than 3 min. Although crop-foraging parties were composed of all age–sex classes, adult females and particularly adult males initiated most crop-foraging events and made direct movements (without stopping on the road) more often than nonadult participants. Baboons made up to five successive attempts to crop forage in a single crop-foraging event. Neither the number of participants nor the success of the crop-foraging events increased over the successive attempts. Finally, crop-foraging events were more successful and more frequent in unguarded areas than in guarded areas. These results suggest that group members are highly synchronized and that crop-foraging is based on a collective decision such as classical foraging movements. In addition, the short duration of the crop-foraging events might prevent detection of baboons by farmers. The more frequent initiation of crop-foraging by adults compared to nonadults might be explained by greater energetic needs or a greater tendency of adults to take risks. These preliminary data can help inform long-term strategies for farmers to reduce crop losses to baboons, as guarding helps reduce damage but does not prevent it.},

Much research effort is now dedicated to coastal southern African Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites. This record is still relatively small compared with the Middle Palaeolithic of Europe, and much of the original sites have been lost due to erosional sea level changes tied to glacial to interglacial cycles. However, more explicit conceptual frameworks for understanding coastal adaptation and its evolutionary role in this region have recently been put forward. Partly stimulated by human nutrition studies, coastal resources, especially shellﬁsh, have acquired an unchecked high status in research agendas. Limited local ethnography on coastal foragers and a lack formalised methodologies for inter-site comparison on coastal resource procurement are evident. In this paper, aspects unique to coastal adaptation with particular reference to shellﬁsh collection are explored. Models on the origin and evolution of coastal adaptations must consider cross-cultural ethnographic studies, move away from the simplistic use of shell densities for evaluating procurement intensity and use the much richer Later Stone Age record as a proﬁtable source for testing hypotheses.},

Men and women are motivated to remain pair-bonded to maintain the distribution of male-provisioned resources to a woman and her offspring, or to protect offspring from infanticide. Men and women can employ several strategies to retain their mate and prevent their partner from defecting from the relationship, including individual mate retention (behaviors performed alone) and coalitional mate retention (behaviors performed by a close ally). The current research investigates whether men and women with children perform more frequent mate retention behaviors than men and women without children. Participants (n = 1003) currently in a heterosexual romantic relationship completed a survey, reporting whether they had genetic children with their current romantic partner and how frequently they performed various mate retention behaviors. The results indicate that men (n = 262) and women (n = 234) who share genetic children with their current partner performed more frequent individual mate retention behaviors and requested more frequent coalitional mate retention behaviors than men (n = 280) and women (n = 227) who do not share genetic children with their current partner. The results are interpreted as they relate to hypotheses concerning the evolution of pair-bonding in humans, and mate retention behaviors more generally. Limitations of the current research are discussed, and profitable avenues for future research in this domain are suggested.},

Briefly, we will propose that moral emotions are the subjective side of the proximate rules (motivations) that regulate human cooperation, which in turn is an evolutionarily novel adaptation to enable the uniquely derived lifestyle of human foragers, which requires generosity and sharing due to extreme mutual interdependence.},

	abstract = {One of the most important economic, social and biological transitions in human history is the shift from food collecting to food producing systems. Competing models regarding the interpretation of the archaeological evidence bring the economic organization of incipient Southwestern farmers into question. Were they committed agriculturalists occupying settled villages, or seasonally mobile groups using agriculture as a buffer to wild resources? Reconstructing the changing economic strategies accompanying the first archaeologically detectable evidence of increased residential stability can be approached from a biological perspective. Bone biology research indicates a clear link between habitual physical activities and skeletal form. Cross-sectional data derived from computed tomographic scans of femoral diaphyses provide a means to test hypotheses regarding relative mobility patterns accompanying the foraging to farming transition.This paper examines femoral cross-sectional property values for Ix/Iy, a proxy for in vivo locomotor behavior, in three samples. Comparative study groups consist of mobile foragers (n = 42) from the Trans- and Lower Pecos regions of southwest Texas, early agriculturalists (n = 21) from the Tucson Basin in southeastern Arizona, and sedentized late agriculturalists (n = 76) from the aggregated prehistoric pueblo of Pottery Mound, New Mexico. The Tucson Basin sample is currently the earliest skeletal series found in association with pre-200 B.C. maize.Statistical analyses indicate that femoral robusticity significantly declined across subsistence categories with increasing dependence on maize. Partitioning by sex and subsistence revealed intriguing patterns. Early agricultural males maintained behaviors necessitating high mobility levels. Female mobility, however, dramatically declined at this time, suggesting that they were spending more time in proximity to residences incorporating the sedentary tasks associated with early domestication into the domain of women’s work.},

In recent years scholars have generated voluminous amounts of data on Spanish colonialism and its effects on the native population of the Americas. This article specifically examines the missionization of the Chumash occupying the coastal region of central California. Although the abandonment of Chumash villages occurred over a 40-year period, the vast majority of the Chumash people - over 85 percent - migrated to the missions between 1786 and 1803. We suggest that the decision to move to the missions may have been based on a desire to minimize risk and was considered an acceptable alternative under the pressures of several interrelated catastrophic events: the period between 1780 and 1830 was characterized by high climatic variability, several years of droughts, and significantly elevated sea surface temperatures. This was a particularly difficult period of high subsistence risk, and the traditional Chumash buffers of trade and political alliances failed under intense pressures of missionization. Compounding these conditions were European diseases that decimated the Chumash people. Primary sources used for this research include mission documents and registers produced by Franciscan missionaries between 1786 and 1834. Information on paleoenvironmental conditions is derived from high-resolution dendrochronological and marine sedimentary records.},

While their efforts are commendable, we feel that their reinterpretations of western North American prehistory overstate the likely influence of costly signaling on the archaeological record. Only by overlooking a considerable body of ethnographic literature that indicates a more limited role for signaling are they able to characterize Great Basin and California hunters as motivated more by the pursuit of prestige than provisioning. We offer three specific challenges to their models: (1) while McGuire and Hildebrandt treat the issue as decided, the relationships among foraging, provisioning, prestige, and fitness is still actively contested among researchers; (2) while ethnographic studies suggest that some types of hunting and low-return, high-risk activities may indeed represent attempts by males to signal costly behavior, these activities contribute very little to the faunal and other residues that accumulate in the archaeological record; and (3) the theoretical underpinnings of costly signaling explicitly preclude the type of runaway positive feedback loops that Hildebrandt and McGuire implicate as the driving force behind an apparent cultural collapse in the Great Basin at the end of the Middle Archaic. /// En varios papeles, McGuire y Hildebrandt recientes y sumamente provocativos (Hildebrandt y McGuire 2002, 2003; McGuire y Hildebrandt 2005) ha ayudado a introducir señalar costoso la teoría en la arqueología Americana.

The possibility that this preference is due to the macronutrient composition of hunted and gathered foods is explored.

Simultaneously, behavioral ecologists have advanced our understanding of sexual division of labor among modern foragers, but these studies appear to have gone unnoticed by Great Basin prehistorians. We review ﬁndings of the last ten years and suggest that the key to understanding patterning in the PHT still relies on understanding (a) variability in men's and women's foraging goals, (b) the abundance and distribution of large prey, (c) how changing environmental parameters effect both the division of labor and the distribution of resources, and (d) the relative inﬂuence of search and handling costs on residence time in PHT wetlands.

	abstract = {An understanding of how age-specific mortality, the aging process, and behavior respond to novel environmental variation requires a theory of how natural selection has acted on our biology over the course of human evolution. This chapter presents such a theory and attempts to make sense of those two opposing views, suggesting that both are partially correct and partially incorrect. We argue that in the environments in which humans spent the majority of their evolutionary history, natural selection has resulted in a species-typical human life span of about seven decades, as part of a larger adaptive complex. We also argue that the human response to the novel environments of today grows out of our evolutionary history and, to a large extent, is predictable. The chapter begins with a general framework for understanding gene-environment interactions affecting age-specific mortality and longevity and the role of natural selection in determining the evolution of population gene distributions over time. We then present an extension of standard life history theory, which we term the "embodied capital theory of life history evolution." These ideas are then applied to an understanding of the human case, and we argue that the adaptive niche occupied by our species selected for a coevolved suite of characteristics, or the human adaptive complex. We then present the theory about why the ability to live at least to age 65 has played an important role in the human adaptation, without which many other human characteristics could not have evolved. Together with a long life span, these characteristics form an adaptive peak that is unique to humans, with other species being at other peaks in the adaptive landscape. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the present and future that derives from this theory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

We conclude in this section that once ecological foraging research began to concentrate upon the behavior of individual animals, the learning abilities of these animals inevitably became a central issue. Specific methodological and conceptual advantages resulting from the integration of psychology and ecology are discussed in the final section. The chapter concludes with comments on real and perceived obstacles to the occurrence of such interdisciplinary integration in the near future.},

Worldwide, recent applications show that progress has been made with regard to recognizing, describing, and modeling the declining foraging efficiency predicted by traditional intensification models that take into account confounding factors like taphonomy, environmental change, and differential foraging goals. Less progress has been made in explaining intensification due to problems of identifying primacy in the environmental, demographic, technological, and social mechanisms that lead to increased production. These problems are confounded by imprecise usage of the concept “intensification,” which runs the gamut from behaviors that either increase or decrease efficiency as the means of increasing productivity. Resolving these problems hinges on unpacking the very concept of intensification as currently applied to hunter-gatherer archaeology. This requires much greater specificity with regard to efficiency and adherence to a Boserupian perspective that declining efficiency marks intensification processes. Alternative modes of increasing production that do not necessarily entail declining efficiency—specialization, diversification, and innovation—also must be taken into account to explain the evolution of hunter-gatherer economies.},

According to one program, often referred to as evolutionary archaeology, cultural change as seen in the archaeological record can best be explained in terms of the direct action of natural selection and other Darwinian processes on heritable variation in artifacts and behavior. The other approach, referred to as evolutionary or behavioral ecology, explains cultural and behavioral change as forms of phenotypic adaptation to varying social and ecological conditions, using the assumption that natural selection has designed organisms to respond to local conditions in fitness‐enhancing ways. We argue that the primary conflict between the two approaches centers on fundamental differences in the way they view the explanatory role of phenotypic variation and more specifically a disagreement over whether behavioral innovation is random with respect to adaptive value (including related issues of current versus future selective advantage and the explanatory role of intentions). These differences lead to contrasts in explanatory scope, empirical application, and theoretical conclusions, which in turn provide the basis for our evaluation of the relative utility of each approach for explaining archaeological phenomena.},

	abstract = {Interspecific communication is common in nature, particularly between mutualists. However, whether signals evolved for communication with other species, or are in fact conspecific signals eavesdropped upon by partners, is often unclear. Fork-tailed drongos (Dicrurus adsimilis) associate with mixed-species groups and often produce true alarms at predators, whereupon associating species flee to cover, but also false alarms to steal associating species' food (kleptoparasitism). Despite such deception, associating species respond to drongo non-alarm calls by increasing their foraging and decreasing vigilance. Yet, whether these calls represent interspecific sentinel signals remains unknown. We show that drongos produced a specific sentinel call when foraging with a common associate, the sociable weaver (Philetairus socius), but not when alone. Weavers increased their foraging and decreased vigilance when naturally associating with drongos, and in response to sentinel call playback. Further, drongos sentinel-called more often when weavers were moving, and weavers approached sentinel calls, suggesting a recruitment function. Finally, drongos sentinel-called when weavers fled following false alarms, thereby reducing disruption to weaver foraging time. Results therefore provide evidence of an 'all clear' signal that mitigates the cost of inaccurate communication. Our results suggest that drongos enhance exploitation of a foraging mutualist through coevolution of interspecific sentinel signals.},

We estimate the degree of intergenerational transmission of three different types of wealth (material, embodied, and relational), as well as the extent of wealth inequality in 21 historical and contemporary populations. We show that intergenerational transmission of wealth and wealth inequality are substantial among pastoral and small-scale agricultural societies (on a par with or even exceeding the most unequal modern industrial economies) but are limited among horticultural and foraging peoples (equivalent to the most egalitarian of modern industrial populations). Differences in the technology by which a people derive their livelihood and in the institutions and norms making up the economic system jointly contribute to this pattern.},

However, where archaeological studies are unable to quantify the costs and benefits associated with prey acquisition, they often rely on proxy measures such as prey body size, assuming it to be positively correlated with return rate. To examine this hypothesis, we analyze the results of 1,347 adult foraging bouts and 649 focal follows of contemporary Martu foragers in Australia's Western Desert. The data show that prey mobility is highly correlated with prey body size and is inversely related to pursuit success-meaning that prey body size is often an inappropriate proxy measure of prey rank. This has broad implications for future studies that rely on taxonomic measures of prey abundance to examine prehistoric human ecology, including but not limited to economic intensification, socioeconomic complexity, resource sustainability, and overexploitation. /// Mediante la integración de modelos de forrajeo de la ecología del comportamiento con las medidas de variabilidad en restos de fauna, estudios zooarqueológicos se han realizado importantes contribuciones para entender la prehistoria del uso de los recursos y las interacciones dinámicas entre los seres humanos y sus presas.

In the present work, observers forage for instances of four target types whose value and prevalence can vary. If value is kept constant and prevalence manipulated, participants consistently show a preference for the most common targets. Patch-leaving behavior follows MVT.

	abstract = {Food storage is a crucial adaptation for hunter-gatherers who face seasonal resource shortfalls, but the extra time that hunter-gatherer s must spend accumulating food surpluses has the potential to conflict with the time they need for other activities during seasons of abundance. Since the activities that conflict with storage may be different for women and men, it is important to consider which gender is responsible for storage. We argue that when women perform most storage tasks, the tradeoff between foraging and childcare is likely to shape storage behavior, particularly the decision of which foods to store. Our analysis of storage food preferences among the prehistoric hunter-gatherers of California's Sierra Nevada suggests that women altered their storage strategy during the late Holocene when the shift to a semi-sedentary settlement system increased the conflict they faced between foraging and providing childcare. The adoption of an acorn-based storage economy during this period allowed women to minimize the time they spent foraging away from their residential bases, so they could better accommodate their childcare needs. This study demonstrates the utility of considering issues beyond the rate of caloric return from foraging to develop more complete models of hunter-gatherer behavior and explanations of the archaeological record. El almacenamiento de la comida es una adaptación crítica para cazadores-recolectores quien se enfrentan déficits estacionales en los alimentos, pero el tiempo que los cazadores-recolectores tienen que gastar en acumular excedentes de comida puede estar en pugna con otras demandas en su tiempo durante las estaciones de abundancia. Como las actividades que están en conflicto con el almacenamiento pueden ser diferentes para hombres y mujeres, también es importante considerar cual sexo es lo responsable para almacenar. Sostenemos que cuando las mujeres hacen la mayoría del trabajo relacionado con almacenamiento, la interacción entre buscar la comida o cuidar los niños va a influenciar su comportamiento con respecto al almacenamiento. Nuestro análisis de las preferencias entre cazadores-recolectores prehistóricos de las montañas de la Sierra Nevada de California sugiere que las mujeres cambiaron su estrategia de almacenamiento durante el Holoceno Tardío cuando el cambio a un sistema de asentamiento semi-sedentario aumentó el conflicto que se enfrentaron entre buscar comida y cuidar los niños. La adopción de una economía basada en el almacenamiento de bellotas durante esta época permitió que las mujeres acomodaran sus necesidades de cuidar niños en una mejora manera. Este estudio muestra la utilidad de considerar asuntos afuera de la taza calórica de retorno de forrajear para desarrollar modelos más completos del comportamiento de los cazadores-recolectores y explicaciones del registro arqueológico.},

From a development perspective, key interventions include the sedentarisation of these mobile peoples into camps nearby larger towns with sanitation infrastructure and medical care, as increased access to services is assumed to improve outcomes. However, recent research in the Agta (Philippine foragers from North-east Luzon) has demonstrated that individuals residing in more ‘developed’ communities suﬀer from increased morbidity and mortality. Here, using quantitative and ethnographic data on health collected between 2002 and 2014, we explore why this trend occurs by examining the relationship between key development initiatives with self-reported illness and the uptake of medical interventions with 415 Agta men, women and children. We demonstrate that health outcomes worsen as sedentarisation progresses, despite some increases in medical access. We argue this is because the development paradigm is not evidence-based, but rather stems from an ideological dislike of mobile hunter-gatherer lifestyles. Compounded by cultural insensitivity and daily discrimination, current interventions are ill-suited to the unique needs of hunter-gatherers, and thus ineﬀective. Based on our ﬁndings we oﬀer future short and long-term policy suggestions which seek to reduce the Agta's vulnerability, rather than increase it.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary origin of human pair-bonds is uncertain. One hypothesis, supported by data from forgers, suggests that pair-bonds function to provision mothers and dependent offspring during lactation. Similarly, public health data from large-scale industrial societies indicate that single mothers tend to wean their children earlier than do women living with a mate. Here we examine relations between pair-bond stability, alloparenting, and cross-cultural trends in breastfeeding using data from 58 “traditional” societies in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS). Analyses show that stable conjugal relationships were associated with significantly later weaning among the societies in the SCCS. The relationship between pair-bond stability and age at weaning was not mediated by women’s ability to provision themselves or women’s kin support. Availability of alloparental care was also inversely related to age at weaning, and the association was not significantly reduced after controlling for frequency of divorce. This study indicates that among a woman’s kin relationships, a pair-bond with a child’s father is especially supportive of breastfeeding. These cross-cultural findings are further evidence that human pair-bonds may have evolved to support lactation.},

	abstract = {Human footprint fossils have provided essential evidence about the evolution of human bipedalism as well as the social dynamics of the footprint makers, including estimates of speed, sex and group composition. Generally such estimates are made by comparing footprint evidence with modern controls; however, previous studies have not accounted for the variation in footprint dimensions coming from load bearing activities. It is likely that a portion of the hominins who created these fossil footprints were carrying a significant load, such as offspring or foraging loads, which caused variation in the footprint which could extend to variation in any estimations concerning the footprint’s maker. To identify significant variation in footprints due to load-bearing tasks, we had participants (N = 30, 15 males and 15 females) walk at a series of speeds carrying a 20kg pack on their back, side and front. Paint was applied to the bare feet of each participant to create footprints that were compared in terms of foot length, foot width and foot area. Female foot length and width increased during multiple loaded conditions. An appreciation of footprint variability associated with carrying loads adds an additional layer to our understanding of the behavior and morphology of extinct hominin populations.},

	title = {Human biological variation during the agricultural transition in prehistoric {Japan}},
	abstract = {This dissertation reconstructs behavioral and biological variation among
prehistoric Jomon foragers and Yayoi agriculturalists using bioarchaeological data. The
Jomon were a group of foragers from Japan dating to approximately 13,000 until 2500
BP. The Yayoi were the first agriculturally dependent people on the Japanese islands,
dating from 2500 until 1700 BP. Data collected from human skeletal remains were used
to test the following hypotheses about these groups: 1) Patterns of systemic stress among
prehistoric Jomon foragers was variable; 2) Systemic stress increased following the
transition to agriculture; 3) Systemic stress patterns among Yayoi agriculturalists was
variable; 4) Differences in body size and proportions will be observed among and
between Jomon foragers and Yayoi agriculturalists; 5) Systemic stress experienced
during the agricultural transition in prehistoric Japan was greater than other East Asian
agriculturalists and improved compared with North American agriculturalists.
Non-specific indicators of stress suggest the Jomon from western Japan
experienced greater disease loads than those from eastern Japan. This trend is associated
with plant dependent diets and resource scarcity in western Japan. Stature variation is,
however, not recorded between these two groups indicating that systemic stress severity
was not different between the eastern and western Jomon. Oral health declined following
the transition to agriculture in prehistoric Japan in association with increased
iii
consumption of carbohydrates. Non-specific indicators of stress reduced in frequency
following the transition to agriculture. These trends indicate that the quality of life for
prehistoric Japanese was generally improved compared to prehistoric North American
agriculturalists and similar to that observed in prehistoric East Asian agriculturalists. In
addition, patterns of health observed among Yayoi agriculturalists, specifically enamel
hypoplasia and stature variation, indicates that the Tanegashima Island Yayoi
experienced greater levels of systemic stress than the Yayoi from Tanegashima Island
and Northern Kyushu. Variation in body proportions among and between the Jomon and
Yayoi is associated with morphological adjustment to climate and differences in systemic
stress levels. The overall results of this dissertation suggest that biological and cultural
responses to environmental variation crossed large portions of geographic and temporal
space in prehistoric Japan.},

We find that Hadza men foraged for a range of food types, including fruit, honey, small animals, and large game. Large game were shared not like common goods, but in ways that significantly advantaged producers’ households. Food sharing and consumption data show that men channeled the foods they produced to their wives, children, and their consanguineal and affinal kin living in other households. On average, single men brought food to camp on 28\% of days, married men without children at home on 31\% of days, and married men with children at home on 42\% of days. Married men brought fruit, the least widely shared resource, to camp significantly more often than single men. A model of the relationship between hunting success and household food consumption indicates that the best hunters provided 3–4 times the amount of food to their families than median or poor hunters. These new data fill important gaps in our knowledge of the subsistence economy of the Hadza and uphold predictions derived from the household and kin provisioning hypotheses. Key evidence and assumptions backing prior claims that Hadza hunting is largely a form of status competition were not replicated in our study. In light of this, family provisioning is a more viable explanation for why good hunters are preferred as husbands and have higher fertility than others.},

	abstract = {Humans have lived in the high Andes for at least 10,000 years, and for most of that time, they were hunting and gathering people. That these adaptations were successful is obvious: Wari, Tiwanaku, and Inca were among the most powerful of the archaic states to arise in the Andes and each had its origin in a high elevation basin. These polities were ultimately based upon the achievements of their distant ancestors, who learned to cope with the rigors of life at high elevation, eventually domesticated plants and animals, and created early forms of social inequality that laid the foundations for persistent forms of leadership and hierarchy. In this chapter I will outline what we know of these early foraging people, and situate them within their ecological, biological, and chronological contexts. The time frame to be considered ranges from approximately 11,000 BC to 1800 BC, and is commonly known as the Archaic or Preceramic Period [Note 1]. Specific questions to be addressed include the following: the timing of and processes by which the high Andes were permanently occupied, the adaptive radiation of foragers after permanent settlement had been achieved, the nature of social formations and their interactions, subsistence change through time and the emergence of different forms of low-level food production, and finally, persistent leadership and the origins of social inequality.},

These include 1,384 indigenous Shuar from the Upano Valley of Ecuador and surrounding areas, 570 nonindigenous colono (or colonist) children from the same area, and 42 Shiwiar from the interior of Ecuador. We use differences between these populations in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) z-scores to assess the effects of changing subsistence patterns on Shuar growth and nutrition. Although, for all three groups, mean height-for-age z-scores were negative, Shuar z-scores were signiﬁcantly lower than either colono or Shiwiar z-scores. Mean weight-for-age z-scores were also negative for Shuar and colono juveniles, while mean BMI-for-age and weight-for-height z-scores were greater than zero for all three groups. Using NHANES standards, 41\% of male and 38\% of female Shuar were classiﬁed as stunted, versus 16\% of male and 20\% of female colonos. Compared to Shuar, colonos were three times less likely to be stunted (OR 5 0.33, P {\textless} 0.01) and Shiwiar were eight times less likely to be stunted (OR 5 0.13, P 5 0.01).

among Ache foragers in eastern Paraguay. Successes and failures of simple models
from optimal foraging theory (OFT) are discussed and revisions are suggested in order
to bring the models in line with empirical evidence from the Ache. The following conclusions
emerge: (1) Energetic returns from various alternative resources and foraging
strategies is probably the best single predictor of foraging patterns. (2) Nutrient constraints
should be added only when they significantly improve the predictive power of
the model. Importance of meat versus vegetable resources may be one important modification
based on nutrients that enhances the ability of OFT models to account for
empirical reality in human foragers. (3) Men's and women's abilities and foraging
patterns differ enough that they should be treated separately in all OFT analyses. (4)
Opportunity costs associated with resources that are processed when foraging is not
possible may be sufficiently low to predict that high processing time resources will be
included in the optimal diet even when their associated return rates (including processing)
are lower than mean foraging returns. (5) When food sharing is extensive and
foraging bands include several adult males and females, foragers may not need to modify
foraging strategies in other ways in order to reduce the risk of not eating on some days.},

The subset of households involved in reciprocal meal sharing is 26 of 84 household host-guest pairs. The frequency of reciprocal meal sharing between families in this subset is positively correlated with average household relatedness.

Inflorescence display size, a dynamic part of pollinator attraction, influences pollinator behaviour and movement. Thus, a rapid increase in display size as plants begin flowering caused by initially rapid flower anthesis should promote recruitment of pollinators to newly flowering individuals and species. Tests of two assumptions of this hypothesis for Delphinium glaucum revealed: 1) declining anthesis rate during a plant’s flowering period is an intrinsic characteristic of inflorescence architecture, rather than a response to internal resource economy; and 2) pollinator limitation early during the flowering period reduced ovule fertilization and elevated autogamous self-mating. These results suggest that rapidly increasing initial display size largely contributed to the quality, rather than the quantity of female mating. Consequences for male outcross success remain to be assessed.},

	abstract = {The embodied-capital theory generalizes existing life history theory in evolutionary biology by treating the processes of growth, development and maintenance as investments in stocks of somatic or embodied-capital. In a physical sense, embodied capital is organized somatic tissue—muscles, digestive organs, brains, etc. In a functional sense, embodied capital includes strength, immune function, coordination, skill, knowledge, and other abilities. Since such stocks tend to depreciate with time, allocations to maintenance can also be seen as investments in embodied capital. There are two trade-os aecting natural selection on fertility. The first is the trade-o between present and future reproduction. By growing, an organism can increase its energy capture rates in the future and thus increase its future fertility. This can be understood in terms of optimal investments in own embodied capital vs. reproduction. The second trade-o is between quantity and quality of ospring, where quality is a function of parental investment in ospring and reflects its ability to survive and reproduce. This can be understood in terms of investments in the embodied- capital of ospring. Natural selection has resulted in physiological and psychological mechanisms by which individuals adjust fertility onset and fertility rates in relation to changing environmental conditions. Embodied-capital theory links several existing theories of demographic transition and, in so doing, provides a new perspective on each one. It rationalizes the shift from natural fertility to parity-specific fertility in terms of a changing quality\vphantom{\{}\}quantity trade-o, as a transition from high fertility\vphantom{\{}\}low parental investment to low fertility\vphantom{\{}\}high parental investment. It also shows why the shift to lower mortality rates can lead to lower fertility, but for very dierent reasons than traditional demographic transition theory proposes.},

According to Allen Johnson's deft ethnography, the Matsigenka people of southeastern Peru cannot be understood or appreciated except as a family level society; the family level of sociocultural integration is for them a lived reality. Under ordinary circumstances, the largest social units are individual households or small extended-family hamlets. In the absence of such "tribal" features as villages, territorial defense and warfare, local or regional leaders, and public ceremonials, these people put a premium on economic self-reliance, control of aggression within intimate family settings, and freedom to believe and act in their own perceived self-interest. Johnson shows how the Matsigenka, whose home is the Amazon rainforest, are able to meet virtually all their material needs with the skills and labor available to the individual household. They try to raise their children to be independent and self-reliant, yet in control of their emotional, impulsive natures, so that they can get along in intimate, cooperative living groups. Their belief that self-centered impulsiveness is dangerous and self-control is fulfilling anchors their moral framework, which is expressed in abundant stories and myths. Although, as Johnson points out, such people are often described in negative terms as lacking in features of social and cultural complexity, he finds their small-community lifestyle efficient, rewarding, and very well adapted to their environment.},

We assess the role of these processes in the success of humans compared to other now extinct Homo species.We concentrate particularly on cooperation, cooperative hunting, and active teaching. We show that teaching can increase the probability of a trait with marginal fitness benefits becoming fixed in the population, that this effect is strengthened by oblique transmission, and that teaching can increase the speed of cultural evolution.Finally, we show that the evolution of cooperation is strengthened by homophily, in which cooperative individuals prefer to partner with other cooperators, and that strong transmission of cooperative norms can support the evolution of costly sharing practices through cultural niche construction.},

Earlier phases of the project were conducted on Jamaican Maroon sites, including Nanny Town, Old Accompong Town, Seaman's Valley, Gun Barrel, and Reeder's Pen. This research contributed to a better understanding of the complexity of the Maroon past, including interactions between Maroons and dominant Atlantic cultural groups, as well as freedom- fighting partnerships Maroons forged with indigenous peoples and enslaved Africans. These studies have also explored Maroon survival strategies and their guerrilla lifestyle, using archaeological evidence for the first time, to examine the flexibility of Maroon sociospatial relationships as well as the formative process and subsequent transformations of their settlements and culture. As with any long- Term investigation, many questions remain unanswered. However, cultural data on settlement locations and patterns, spatial behavior, mortuary practices, technological strategies, artifact patterns, and soil chemical analysis and dating have shed light on land use, spatial relationships, group dynamics, and other aspects of the Maroon experience. Our objective has been to employ archaeological evidence, supported by ethnographic and archival data, to identify the range of Maroon cultural responses and adaptations and thus to create a more nuanced understanding of the ecological, social, and economic conditions experienced by Maroons during the colonial era. Maroon archaeology has revealed that a complex set of interactions emerged from the oppressive context of plantation slavery. Furthermore, the material evi dence of Maroon resistance to the plantation complex in the Americas challenges the historiographical assumptions that relegate the achievements of small- scale societies to a secondary place in New World history. Rather than a marginal aberration, the Maroon experience was a central, defining feature of the post- 1500 Atlantic world.},

In this article I review the methodological and practical strengths and weaknesses of current zooarchaeological applications of foraging models. Recent applications of foraging models to the zooarchaeological record reveal important variability in human-prey interactions across time and space. Case-specific applications generate theoretical and methodological advances that augment and are complementary to model building in allied fields. Recent applications also identify shortcomings in the underlying assumptions and rationale of some foraging models that mirror past and on-going discussions in anthropology and biology. I discuss how these shortcomings can fruitfully direct future applications and research in foraging economics.},

Because the approach often focuses on how behavioral adjustments to changing socio-ecological conditions create novel selective pressures that in turn drive other changes in morphology and behavior, it draws on the same evolutionary logic that underlies niche construction theory. We illustrate here the important role that niche construction has played in archaeological applications of evolutionary ecology with two detailed case studies: one from Late Holocene hunter-gatherer populations in Central California and one from Mimbres-Mogollon agriculturalists in New Mexico. These examples illustrate that evolutionary ecology-based approaches, with an emphasis on formal predictive modeling, allow for the incorporation of niche construction as it affects model parameters with reference to specific problems involving past behavior. Further modeling and empirical applications will expand the synergies between these complementary approaches and advance our understanding of the human past.},

We evaluate the effects of social complexity (as indexed by group size) and foraging complexity (as indexed by percent fruit and seeds in the diet) on the length of the juvenile period, brain size, and brain ratios (neocortex and executive brain ratios) while controlling for positive covariance among body size, life span, and home range. Results support strong components of diet, life span, and population density acting on juvenile periods and of home range acting on relative brain sizes. Social-complexity arguments for the evolution of primate intelligence are compelling given strong positive correlations between brain ratios and group size while controlling for potential confounding variables. We conclude that both social and ecological components acting at variable intensities in different primate clades are important for understanding variation in primate life histories.},

However, tests of this hypothesis are obscured by comparing between populations that vary in ecology and social organization, as well as subsistence3–6. Here we test this hypothesis by examining adult time allocation among the Agta—a population of small-scale hunter-gatherers from the northern Philippines who are increasingly engaged in agriculture and other non-foraging work. We find that individuals in camps engaging more in non-foraging work spend more time involved in out-of-camp work and have substantially less leisure time. This difference is largely driven by changes in the time allocation of women, who spend substantially more time engaged in out-of-camp work in more agricultural camps. Our results support the hypothesis that hunting and gathering allows a significant amount of leisure time, and that this is lost as communities adopt small-scale agriculture.},

The energetic consequences of differences between archaic and modern humans can therefore provide insight into how modern humans were ultimately able to out‐compete their archaic counterparts. Here we investigate three major areas of differentiation between archaic and modern humans that likely had significant energetic ramifications, and for which reliable fossil evidence exists: body size, locomotor anatomy, and juvenile growth. Using these data, we explore potential energetic disparities between archaic and modern humans in terms of proportions of energy budgets of reproductively active adults dedicated to maintenance (basic life functions and physical activity) versus offspring production. In comparison to modern humans, adult archaic humans would have had higher maintenance costs corresponding to their larger bodies (higher resting and activity energy requirements) and shorter lower limbs (reduced locomotor efficiency). Moreover, faster growth rates in archaic juveniles could have meant slightly higher daily energy requirements for dependent offspring in archaic versus modern humans. Overall, assuming similar caloric returns from foraging in both groups, modern humans' smaller bodies, longer lower limbs, and slower development may have allowed them to produce a greater number of viable offspring over the reproductive lifespan than could archaic humans, possibly at a ratio of ˜6:5. These reproductive differences may have facilitated higher population densities among modern humans, likely contributing to the rise of modern humans and disappearance of archaic forms.},

This article focuses on the implications of being large bodied for Homo erectus females, estimated to have been over 50\% heavier than average australopithecine females. The energy requirements of these hominins are modeled using data on activity patterns, body mass, and life history from living primates. Particular attention is given to the inferred energetic costs of reproduction for Homo erectus females based on chimpanzee and human reproductive scheduling. Daily energy requirements during gestation and lactation would have been significantly higher for Homo erectus females, as would total energetic cost per offspring if the australopithecines and Homo erectus had similar reproductive schedules (gestation and lactation lengths and interbirth intervals). Shortening the interbirth interval could considerably reduce the costs per offspring to Homo erectus and have the added advantage of increasing reproductive output. The mother would, however, incur additional daily costs of caring for the dependent offspring. If Homo erectus females adopted this reproductive strategy, it would necessarily imply a revolution in the way in which females obtained and utilized energy to support their increased energetic requirements. This transformation is likely to have occurred on several levels involving cooperative economic division of labor, locomotor energetics, menopause, organ size, and other physiological mechanisms for reducing the energetic load on females.},

Existing explanations for this prioritization argue that it is more consequential for an observer’s welfare than is competence. We develop a new explanation for the prioritization of warmth, based on cooperative partner choice. A review of the anthropological literature suggests that, over the course of human evolution, there was greater variance in the warmth than competence of potential cooperative partners, but greater variance in competence over time within cooperative relationships. We present agent-based models showing that these features of the ecology promote the evolution of the prioritization of warmth over competence, suggesting that this prioritization is due to an asymmetry in their distributions, not in their necessary consequences, per se. Future directions for the study of social perception and preferences more broadly are discussed.},

	title = {Ecological {Constraints} and {Life} {History} {Tradeoffs} {Among} {Human} {Foragers} and {Their} {Prey}},
	abstract = {This dissertation attempts to identify ecological relationships useful for
understanding large-scale patterns in human-environment interaction that can be applied
to archaeological studies. It uses three established bodies of theory to understand
ecological constraints and life history tradeoffs, applying the same basic framework to
human adaptations and the demographic trends of other mammals. First, a model from
optimal foraging theory (the marginal value theorem), which posits a tradeoff between
resource availability and resource processing, is applied to zooarchaeology to understand
human butchery patterns. Humans tend to butcher prey according to the predictions of the
model in both ethnographic and archaeological settings: they process carcasses more
intensively when prey are rare. Moreover, evaluation of the statistical and taphonomic 
ix
factors that could affect prehistoric faunal data demonstrates that even coarse-measures
of butchery intensity can uncover the predicted tradeoff.
Life history theory can link energetic and environmental constraints to
demographic parameters and is therefore useful for understanding the unique features of
humans that may have been responsible for their geographic expansion in addition to how
their prey might adjust to changes in mortality or energy availability. Lifetime
reproductive effort captures the tradeoffs among adult size, lifespan, and reproductive
effort to yield an aggregate dimensionless measure highly useful for summarizing the life
histories of different organisms for cross-species comparison. The second study in this
dissertation examines lifetime reproductive effort to see if humans have diverged from
most mammals with respect to this important life history metric. This measure shows that
while we (humans) differ in many individual life history attributes, in the aggregate we
converge on the same optimal solution as other organisms, given simple constraints on
production and mortality. This suggests that some of the unique features of humans (postreproductive lifespans, extensive food-sharing, and long juvenile periods) have not
caused a divergence from the factors constraining other optimal life histories. While
humans have re-organized the lifespan, allocation of energy to reproduction during the
lifespan is nonetheless constrained by some fundamental ecological constraint. This helps
place human life history evolution in a broader context for understanding the causes and
consequences of the factors that allowed humans to diverge from other mammals.
General patterns between body size, abundance, and geographical area exist in
ecology that can help archaeologists understand how prey respond demographically to
changes in resource availability and/or predation pressure. Following this motivation the 
x
third study uses population viability analysis (PVA) to explore the causes of relative
extinction risk among terrestrial mammals. The model predicts that relative extinction
risk is a peaked function of body mass such that risk is minimized at about 100 grams,
which is near the modal size in continental faunas and the size that species colonizing
islands from continental mainlands converge upon. This suggests that the model captures
a key feature of the dynamics governing the evolution of size and probability of
extinction. It also applies to life history evolution by demonstrating that variation in
growth rate, population density, and generation length interact such that an optimal
strategy exists for staying in the ‘evolutionary game’ (i.e., avoiding extinction). Debates
about the loss of Pleistocene megafauna center on climate and human hunting as
opposing causes. The model provides modest support for the view that humans may be
responsible for the bias towards large body size in the extinct species. The model is also
useful for understanding the demographic attributes of human prey, generally, and has
many further applications for understanding life history evolution and population stability
in humans and other mammals.
Across the three studies a number of useful tools are developed for identifying
large-scale tradeoffs that can be used to understand human population dynamics, foraging
behavior, and their implications for resource use and geographic range expansion. The
same set of techniques is also useful for uncovering the connections between human
attributes and those of the species they influence via predation and/or the altering of
ecosystems. These techniques are valuable theoretical developments for the building of a
more robust environmental and/or ecological archaeology (anthropology).},

The highly consistent dating of Clovis archaeological sites (11,500-10,800 B.P.) suggests that this continent was populated within a matter of centuries. To explain the spatial and temporal scales of this phenomenon, it is necessary to invoke both high mobility and high fertility rates during the initial colonization process. However, it is widely believed that it is maladaptive for mobile foragers to have large numbers of offspring due to the costs of transporting those children. Thus, the archaeological record presents us with a paradox. Using a mathematical model that estimates the costs of raising children for mobile hunter-gatherers, this paper asks the question-is high mobility compatible with high fertility? It is concluded that high mobility, if defined as the frequent movement of residential base camps, is quite compatible with high fertility, and that early Paleoindians could indeed have been characterized by high reproductive rates. Therefore, it is quite possible that the Americas were populated very rapidly by highly mobile hunter-gatherers.},

In doing so, males would have assisted females in achieving and maintaining an energetic condition sufﬁcient for reproduction, thereby hastening the advent of shortened interbirth intervals that played a formative role in the success of our genus.},

To answer the question, I estimate the caloric returns per hour of labor devoted to foraging wild species and cultivating the cereals exploited by the first farmers, using data on foragers and landabundant hand-tool farmers in the ethnographic and historical record, as well as archaeological evidence. A convincing answer must account not only for the work of foraging and cultivation but also for storage, processing, and other indirect labor, and for the costs associated with the delayed nature of agricultural production and the greater exposure to risk of those whose livelihoods depended on a few cultivars rather than a larger number of wild species. Notwithstanding the considerable uncertainty to which these estimates inevitably are subject, the evidence is inconsistent with the hypothesis that the productivity of the first farmers exceeded that of early Holocene foragers. Social and demographic aspects of farming, rather than its productivity, may have been essential to its emergence and spread. Prominent among these aspects may have been the contribution of farming to population growth and to military prowess, both promoting the spread of farming as a livelihood.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary approaches to agency offer some of the most promising frameworks for identifying individual agents and their archaeological correlates. Agency theory calls attention to the individual as the fundamental feature of human relations, and evolutionary theory provides historically situated models that allow archaeologists to precisely investigate the complex behavioral strategies that underlie artifact patterns. The following paper offers one such model. Using data from 41 slave-site occupations from eighteenth-century Virginia, I explore how and why enslaved African Americans actively participated in the burgeoning "consumer revolution" that swept across the early modern Atlantic World. Artifact patterning suggests that the acquisition and display of costly imported goods functioned as a form of communication for slaves in both public and private venues. The data show that enslaved women and men used several different consumption strategies to solidify social and economic relationships within precarious and rapidly changing environments. Signaling theory, derived from evolutionary theory, illuminates the contextual factors that structured slaves' consumer choices and provides a model for understanding their choices as the result of dynamic and mutually beneficial behaviors. /// Los enfoques evolutivos a la agencia ofrecen algunos de los esquemas más prometedores para identificar las estrategias y las respuestas de los agentes individuales a otros actores. Mientras que la teoría de la agencia llama la atención al individuo como la característica fundamental de las relaciones humanas, la teoría evolutiva proporciona modelos históricamente situados que permiten que los arqueólogos investiguen con precisión las estrategias complejas del comportamiento que subyacen los patrones de nuestros artefactos. Este ensayo ofrece un tal modelo. Usando datos de 41 yacimientos de esclavos, ocupados durante el siglo XVIII en Virginia, exploro cómo y por qué los afroamericanos esclavizados participaron activamente en la floreciente "revolución del consumidor" que se extendió a través del mundo atlántico a principios de la Edad Moderna. El patrón en los artefactos sugiere que la adquisición y la exhibición de artículos costosos importados funcionaron como una forma de comunicación para los esclavos en locales públicos y privados. Los datos demuestran que las mujeres y los hombres esclavizados utilizaron diversas estrategias de consumo para solidificar las relaciones sociales y económicas dentro de ambientes precarios y rápidamente cambiantes. La teoría de señalización, derivada de la teoría evolutiva, aclara los factores contextuales que estructuraron las opciones de consumo de los esclavos y proporciona un modelo para entender sus opciones como resultado de comportamientos dinámicos y mutuamente beneficiosos.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Previous research among foragers and theory suggests that nonmaternal caregivers offer essential assistance, which supports female reproduction and the costs associated with lengthy child development. Mothers’ face trade-offs in energy allocation between work and childcare, particularly when mothers have an infant. These trade-offs likely have crucial impacts on the pace of reproduction and child health. Caregivers can help mothers with childcare or they can reduce a mother’s nonchildcare workload. If caregivers assist mothers by substituting childcare, then maternal energy expenditure (EE) in other work activities should increase. If caregivers assist mothers by substituting labor, then maternal EE in work activities should decrease when caregivers are present.
Methods: Utilizing detailed, quantitative behavioral observations and EE data, we test these propositions with data from 28 Aka forager mothers with children {\textless}35 months old. We isolate paternal, grandmaternal, and other caregiver effects on maternal EE and childcare in multivariate analyses.
Results: Our results show that caregivers (largely grandmothers) signiﬁcantly reduce mothers’ work EE by as much 216 kcal across a 9-hour observation period, while fathers and juveniles appear to increase maternal EE. Direct childcare from grandmothers decreases maternal direct care by about one-to-one indicating a labor substitution. Direct childcare from fathers decreases maternal care by almost 4 to 1, resulting in a net reduction of total direct care from all caregivers.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that there are multiple pathways by which helpers offset maternal work/childcare trade-offs. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 25:42–57, 2013. ' 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In other words, do Achuar (Shiwiar) hunting patterns maintain the group’s “harmony” or “balance with nature” behaving as conservationists, or do they act as resource maximizers acting in ways predicted by optimal foraging theory? Analysis of indigenous hunters’ prey choice in light of patch selection and optimal diet breadth models indicate that the Achuar (with few exceptions) are overharvesting local populations of various species of Neotropical wildlife. Significantly, this research documents differential species vulnerability to indigenous hunting pressure which, in turn, affects the sustainability of Amazonian wildlife harvests. Additionally, this research illustrates how a relatively isolated egalitarian and autonomous Amerindian group of subsistence hunter–horticulturalists, who maintain many of the traditional beliefs about wildlife population dynamics, are fully capable of overhunting several species of Neotropical wildlife. As such, the overharvesting of various types of wild game by the Achuar cannot be considered as being an artifact of Western contact. Lastly, this work examines some of the ethical issues raised by these findings.},

@article{kelly_colonization_2003,
	title = {Colonization of new land by hunter-gatherers},
	abstract = {Nearly all of the world was initially colonized by people equipped with a foraging
adaptation. How hunter-gatherers adapt to “empty” land masses, therefore, is a question that is essential to understanding an important segment of human history. It is a
frustrating question, however, for there are no easy analogies. We have no cases of
ethnographically known hunter-gatherers moving into terra incognita.1 Yet too often
it is assumed that the first prehistoric foragers to occupy a region fit an ethnographic
model, one based on only one or two ethnographic cases that serve as simple
ethnographic analogies. In recent decades, it has been the Ju/’hoansi (the !Kung, San,
Basarwa, or Bushmen), or some amalgam of Arctic groups (Kelly 1996). But it is clear
that such analogies are not always useful even when examining later Holocene foragers
(Kelly 1995). How much less so for colonizing populations that faced environmental and
social circumstances that would have been foreign to ethnographically known foragers?
The purpose of this volume is to move toward a better understanding of how
humans initially occupy large land masses about which nothing was known, about
which nothing could have been encoded into oral history or folklore, about which the
accumulated wisdom of grandparents and great-grandparents was silent. This chapter’s contribution is to ask what ethnographically known hunter-gatherers have to
contribute to this venture. Since there are no analogies to call upon, our effort is aimed
at looking at how ethnographically known hunter-gatherers “know” their landscape
and what this might suggest about foragers entering unoccupied continents. It is most
likely that different land masses were occupied differently, depending on a number of
variables such as population density, the particular environment (e.g. the Australian
desert versus the Siberian taiga), and the adaptation that the colonizers brought with
them to the new land. But in writing this paper I must admit that in the back of my
mind is the colonization of the western hemisphere.},

Evolutionary genetics (Ingman et al. 2000; Tishkoff et al. 2007; Gonder et al. 2007; Fagundes et al. 2007; Behar et al. 2008) point to the time between 200 and 100 ka as the origin point for the modern human lineage. Modern humans have relatively very low genetic diversity that is best explained by one or more population bottlenecks late in the evolution of the lineage, with estimates for the first bottleneck ranging from 144 ka (103,535–185,642 ka 95\%CI) (Fagundes et al. 2007) to 194.3 ± 32.5 ka (Gonder et al. 2007) to 203 ± 12.6 ka (Behar et al. 2008). Fagundes et al. (2007) estimate the effective population of that bottleneck at ∼600 (76–1,620 95\%CI). A computer simulation by Rogers reported in (Ambrose 1998) suggests that this bottlenecked population was a single contiguous breeding group in one region, since if this population sampled a broad range of populations across Africa the original genetic variation would have been preserved. This bottleneck seems to have occurred during the glacial MIS6 (∼195–125 ka), one of the longest coldest stages of the Quaternary (Petit et al. 1999), during which time Africa would have been primarily dry with relatively few isolated refugia.

	abstract = {This review traces the colonization of Eurasia by hominids some 1,700,000 years ago and their subsequent evolution there to 10,000 years ago from a carnivorous perspective. Three zooarchaeological trends reflect important shifts in hominid adaptations over this great time span: (1) increasing predation on large, hoofed animals that culminated in prime-adult-biased hunting, a predator-prey relationship that distinguishes humans from all other large predators and is a product of coevolution with them; (2) greater diet breadth and range of foraging substrates exploited in response to increasing human population densities, as revealed by small-game use; and (3) increased efficiency in food capture, processing, and energy retention through technology, and the eventual expansion of technology into social (symbolic) realms of behavior. Niche boundary shifts, examined here in eight dimensions, tend to cluster at 500 thousand years ago (KYA), at 250 KYA, and several in rapid succession between 50 and 10 KYA. Most of these shifts appear to be consequences of competitive interaction, because high-quality, protein-rich resources were involved. Many of the boundary shifts precede major radiations in the equipment devoted to animal exploitation. With a decline in trophic level after 45 KYA, demographic increase irreversibly altered the conditions of natural selection on human societies, from a largely interspecific competitive forum to one increasingly defined by intraspecific pressures. Regionalization of Upper Paleolithic artifact styles is among the many symptoms of this process.},

We are distinctive among the hominids in exhibiting direct paternal care, making this behavioral suite most likely a derived trait in Homo sapiens that contributed to the evolution of our unique life history traits such as long lives, higher fertility relative to other great apes, an extended juvenile period of development, and altricial offspring. Humans are also exceptional among primates in that our wide range of care includes men who raise children without the potential for female involvement. Bi-paternal care by two pair-bonded males, in the form of gay fatherhood, is close to the logical end-point of the spectrum of facultative paternal care in our species. The essentially unique nature of this behavior among mammals generally cannot be overlooked. However, despite nearly two decades of literature exploring the hormonal correlates of paternal care in humans, gay fathers have not received the same level of biosocial research attention.},

Here we review examples of BQ functions in animal behavior, both in the natural world and in human economies, with a focus on how these functions encourage the evolution of specialization and division of labor. The non-human examples we consider range from microbial systems to vertebrate communities while the human examples consider economic agents ranging from foraging societies to superpowers. With these examples, we discuss four classes of BQ functions: (i) functions that protect against harmful things in the environment; (ii) functions that provide products with value added relative to their constituent parts; (iii) functions that provide structures that can be utilized by other organisms; and (iv) functions that yield information. We also explore a set of examples where BQ-stabilized commensal relationships developed into two-way exchange relationships in human systems: (i) the ancient mutualism between humans and dogs, (ii) the division of labor in human societies between sexes and age groups, and (iii) the dominance of Silicon Valley over other regional technology centers. We conclude that BQ functions are an underappreciated motivator of markets and communities and suggest future experimental evolution research encouraged by our perspective.},

	abstract = {The study of adaptation in Neanderthals is confounded by equifinality – the existence of multiple adaptive pathways to the same morphological end state – manifest as an inability to discriminate between equally likely selective agents behind a given trait. The capacious chests of Neanderthals serve as one example, possibly representing an adaptation either to cold or to high activity levels. While single features may be adaptive in multiple contexts, their relative adaptive value may vary greatly between contexts. Without means of evaluating competing adaptive arguments, we have little hope of identifying the primary selective agents that operated on Neanderthal body form. Bioenergetics provides a basis for quantifying the costs and benefits of various adaptive solutions to a given environmental challenge – thus providing potential for resolving issues of equifinality. Evaluating claims of cold-adapted morphology in Neanderthals involves determining the energetic costs of adhering to Bergmann's and Allen's rules. Skin surface area (SA) is the major determinant of basal metabolic rate (BMR) in mammals, thus estimating Neanderthal SA allows an estimate of the caloric cost of their coldadapted body form. Clinical equations exist for estimating SA from stature and mass, but these have never been tested on humans of extreme (i.e., “hyper-arctic”) body form. A half-size reconstruction of a male European Neanderthal was used to test the utility of these formulae: results indicate that they can be used confidently to predict Neanderthal SA. Based on Neanderthals for whom mass and stature can be reasonably estimated, mean SA is greater than that of Inuit of comparable stature, and suggests higher BMRs in Neanderthals than reported in previous studies.},

	abstract = {I have pulled together a variety of information concerning protein as a nutrient, focusing particularly on protein’s costs and potentially undesirable effects when consumed in large amounts. Intakes of protein (plant and animal combined) above about ∼200–250 g per day can lead to weight loss, lethargy, and weakness, and, if sustained long enough, death. Such intakes can also be detrimental, even toxic, to the fetus and nursing newborn, lowering birth weight and increasing the chances of cognitive disorders, morbidity, and perinatal mortality. Because of its high-specific dynamic action (SDA), protein is also an inefficient way to provide energy to the body, whether for general metabolic needs or specifically for fueling the brain. It is also not the ideal nutrient for brain growth, which requires considerable inputs of fatty acids, particularly the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Aside from brain, the meat and organs from wild ungulates, African or otherwise, are limited, costly, and inefficient sources of DHA (see data in Crawford et al. 1969; Cordain et al. 2001, 2002b).},

	abstract = {Human pair bonding is often attributed to the importance of male provisioning. However, this has been called into question in recent years. Among tropical hunter–gatherers like the Hadza of Tanzania, the foods that men acquire contribute less to the diet than women's foods, are acquired with less regularity, and are shared more widely outside the household. This forces us to ask what benefits forager women gain from being married. Here, I present data suggesting that Hadza women benefit from a husband's provisioning when they have young nurslings. During this critical period, women have lower foraging returns and return rates, while their husbands have higher returns. These higher returns are not due to more meat, but to less widely shared foods, like honey. Even if women are subsidizing husbands much of the time, provisioning by husbands during this critical period of lactation could be enough to favor pair bonding.},

Simulations show that social living decreases daily risk of no food, but cooperative hunting has only a modest effect on mean harvest rates.

	abstract = {Chapter 24 offers an overview of the history and basic premises of human behavioral ecology (HBE ), which as been especially widely used by zooarchaeologists studying foragers in the United States. It begins with a history of HBE as it emerged from zoology and through simple examples outlines classic rate maximization models of prey choice and foraging patch choice. Given that many zooarchaeological studies have used them, central place models (CPM ) are detailed, as are the complexities of resource depression, again given the many zooarchaeological studies investigating this phenomenon with archaeofaunal data. Used in zoology for several decades, dynamic state variable models (DSVM) of foraging diverge from “static” rate-maximization models in incorporating the forager’s state before foraging, using multiple currencies (e.g. calories and fat), and including more fitness-shaping factors such as risk of death in a patch in the model, while using iterative simulations to stochastically vary patch conditions in which the forager makes decisions. Actualistic and archaeological studies using DSVM and other dynamic models suggest that income variance reduction, rather than rate maximization, is the predicted “solution” for optimal fitness. The role of proxies and their sensitivities to factors other than those of the model are explored, with the specific example of the Artiodactyl Index. The most interesting aspect of HBE’s application in zooarchaeology lies its ability to systematically expose cases in which people do not behave like “optimal foragers” but instead opt – or perhaps are forced – to forage in some other way, as examples show. The difference between using HBE predictive models as tools for inquiry with a dataset versus as explanations of the data is discussed.},

Several hypotheses which relte cultural and life-course parameters to bargaining power are tested against data on the frequency of cooperative sail-fishing participation. Consistent with predictions generated from bargaining theory, we show that (1) age is negatively correlated with cooperative fishing participation, (2) men of highranking clans and men with high levels of education fish less than men of low-ranking clans and less-educated men, (3) men with high expected utility gains from fishing returns fish more than men with low expected utility gains, (4) number of dependents is positively correlated with cooperative fishing participation, and (5) the number of young genetic offspring residing with a man is positively correlated with cooperative fishing participation, whereas the number of genetic offspring more than 13 years old who are residing with a man is negatively correlated with cooperative fishing participation.},

	volume = {7},
	shorttitle = {Are we monogamous?},
	abstract = {Despite a long history of study, consensus on a human-typical mating system remains elusive. While a simple classification would be useful for cross-species comparisons, monogamous, polyandrous, and polygynous marriage systems exist across contemporary human societies. Moreover, sexual relationships occur outside of or in tandem with marriage, resulting in most societies exhibiting multiple kinds of marriage and mating relationships. Further complicating a straightforward classification of mating system are the multiple possible interpretations of biological traits typical of humans used to indicate ancestral mating patterns. While challenging to characterize, our review of the literature offers several key insights. 1) Although polygyny is socially sanctioned in most societies, monogamy is the dominant marriage-type within any one group cross-culturally. 2) Sex outside of marriage occurs across societies, yet human extra pair paternity rates are relatively low when compared to those of socially monogamous birds and mammals. 3) Though the timing of the evolution of certain anatomical characteristics is open to debate, human levels of sexual dimorphism and relative testis size point to a diverging history of sexual selection from our great ape relatives. Thus, we conclude that while there are many ethnographic examples of variation across human societies in terms of marriage patterns, extramarital affairs, the stability of relationships, and the ways in which fathers invest, the pair-bond is a ubiquitous feature of human mating relationships. This may be expressed through polygyny and/or polyandry but is most commonly observed in the form of serial monogamy.},

	title = {Ancient and recent {Australian} desert hunter-gatherer responses to climatic variability},
	abstract = {In this thesis I examine the ethnographic record of recent arid-zone Australian hunter-gatherers to consider how prehistoric populations may have responded to climate change in similar climatic and ecological settings. The archaeological record of population presence and absence indicates that pulses of territorial abandonment and reoccupation correspond with periods of significant climatic variability, with the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the on-set of modern El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles during the mid-Holocene being identified as significant periods of increased environmental stress and associated habitat abandonment. However modelling such population processes at a fine-grained level is constrained by the differential preservation of archaeological material, dating limitations, issues with chronological control at some sites, and differences in research intensity. As a result the archaeological record is unclear as to whether such population processes involved habitat tracking to more favourable areas, or alternatively resulted in extinction of local groups in areas that became unviable for continued occupation. My thesis addresses this lack of clarity by relating recent hunter-gatherer drought responses to prehistoric population process evident from the archaeological record. I start with an examination of the Arandic and Western Desert societies to provide a background for establishing how desert hunter-gather groups responded to serious drought in the recent past. I look at the cultural and economic strategies developed by these tribal groups in response to distinct but connected environments, and discuss how differences in social organisation between groups occupying distinct ecological regions shaped drought responses. I investigate the socio-cultural and behavioural mechanisms of desert hunter-gatherers that facilitated habitat tracking and develop a framework based on behavioural ecology models to consider how subsistence and mobility strategies enabled range shifts to neighbouring areas during periods of resource depletion. Where drought forced local group extinction is evident, I identify the constraining factors acting on populations that limited their capacity to respond to changing environmental conditions. I argue that water availability is the major constraint to occupation of arid environments, with access to reliable water sources and foraging areas available from water points being a precondition of occupation for both recent and prehistoric arid-zone hunter-gatherers and the main factor limiting population distribution. I propose that extensive social and economic networks linking groups, who were dependent on one another for access to water and resources, were crucial for successful occupation of the Australian desert during the historical period and relied on critical population size, particularly during periods of climatic instability. While the precise social organisation and subsistence strategies employed by prehistoric hunter-gatherer groups is invisible in the archaeological record, I hypothesise that such social and economic networks were likely equally crucial to the survival of prehistoric hunter-gatherers. In the event that critical population size dropped below the threshold for maintaining such networks, continued occupation of marginal environments was unviable.},

The most time-consuming cooperative activity for both sexes is helping during the pursuit of game animals, a pattern that is probably linked to the widespread sharing of game by Ache foragers.

The book aims to reconstruct agricultural decision making using archaeological and paleoenvironmental data from Gordion to describe environmental and agricultural changes at the site.

John M. Marston argues that different political and economic systems implemented over time at Gordion resulted in patterns of agricultural decision making that were well adapted to the social setting of farmers in each period, but that these practices had divergent environmental impacts, with some regimes sponsoring sustainable agricultural practices and others leading to significant environmental change. The implications of this book are twofold: Gordion will now be one of the best published agricultural datasets from the entire Near East and, thus, serve as a valuable comparable dataset for regional synthesis of agricultural and environmental change, and the methods the author developed to reconstruct agricultural change at Gordion serves as tools to engage questions about the relationship between social and environmental change at sites worldwide. Other books address similar themes but none in the Near East address these themes in diachronic perspective such as we have at Gordion.},

	abstract = {This volume presents state-of-the-art empirical studies working in a paradigm that has become known as human behavioral ecology. The emergence of this approach in anthropology was marked by publication by Aldine in 1979 of an earlier collection of studies edited by Chagnon and Irons entitled Evolutionary Biology and Human Social Behavior: An Anthropological Perspective. During the two decades that have passed since then, this innovative approach has matured and expanded into new areas that are explored here.

The book opens with an introductory chapter by Chagnon and Irons tracing the origins of human behavioral ecology and its subsequent development. Subsequent chapters, written by both younger scholars and established researchers, cover a wide range of societies and topics organ-ized into six sections. The first section includes two chapters that provide historical background on the development of human behavioral ecology and com-pare it to two complementary approaches in the study of evolution and human behavior, evolutionary psychology, and dual inheritance theory. The second section includes five studies of mating efforts in a variety of societies from South America and Africa. The third section covers parenting, with five studies on soci-eties from Africa, Asia, and North America. The fourth section breaks somewhat with the tradition in human behavioral ecology by focusing on one particularly problematic issue, the demographic transition, using data from Europe, North America, and Asia. The fifth section includes studies of cooperation and helping behaviors, using data from societies in Micronesia and South America. The sixth and final section consists of a single chapter that places the volume in a broader critical and comparative context.

The contributions to this volume demonstrate, with a high degree of theoretical and methodological sophistication--the maturity and freshness of this new paradigm in the study of human behavior. The volume will be of interest to anthropologists and other professions working on the study of cross-cultural human behavior.},

	abstract = {A large complement of Australia’s biotic web is dependent on a regular regime of burning, much of which is the result of firing by humans. Many researchers have suggested that moderate and repeated burning by Aborigines is a tool designed to enhance hunting efficiency. We present the first test of this with data on contemporary Martu Aboriginal burning and hunting strategies in the arid spinifex savanna of the Western Desert during the cool-dry season (May–August). Our results show a strong positive effect of mosaic burning on the efficiency of hunting burrowed prey (primarily conducted by women), but not larger mobile prey (primarily conducted by men). We suggest that regular anthropogenic disturbance through burning in Australia’s Western Desert may be important for sustaining biodiversity and habitat mosaics, but these effects may be maintained primarily by women’s hunting of burrowed game. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding variability in hunting strategies, issues of conservation, and land management policy for the region.},

Even those scientists working in recent phases of human evolution, when modern humans evolved, agree that hunter-gatherer adaptations are tied to the way that climate and environment shape the food and technological resource base. The result is a long tradition of paleoanthropologists engaging with climate and environmental scientists in an effort to understand if and how hominin bio-behavioral evolution responded to climate and environmental change. Despite this unusual consonance, the anticipated rewards of this synergy are unrealized and, in our opinion, will not reach potential until there are some fundamental changes in the way the research model is constructed. Discovering the relation between climate and environmental change to human origins must be grounded in a theoretical framework and a causal understanding of the connection between climate, environment, resource patterning, behavior, and morphology, then move beyond the strict correlative research that continues to dominate the field.},

	abstract = {Human life history is unique in the great length of its juvenile, or immature, period. This lengthened period1 is often attributed to the time required for youth to master the culture, particularly subsistence and survival skills. But studies in increasing number show that children become skilled well before they gain complete independence and adult status. As children learn through play and participation in the domestic economy, they seem to be acquiring a “reserve capacity” of skills and knowledge that may not be fully employed for many years. To resolve this paradox, the theory offered here poses that this reserve capacity of children, both individually and collectively, can be rapidly activated to offset a shortfall in familial resources brought on by crises such as the loss of older family members. Additionally, social forces engendered by war, disease, famine, and economic change may lead to the wholesale recruitment of children into the labor force—with consequent attenuation of the developmental opportunities of an extended juvenility. In effect, humans display a primary life history strategy and an accelerated strategy with a shortened period of dependency. A wide array of cases from anthropology and history will be offered in support of this proposal.},

While reciprocity explains many instances of non-kin cooperation, much remains to be understood. A recent suite of models based upon ‘cooperative assortativity’ suggest that non-kin cooperation can evolve if individuals preferentially assort with certain cooperative phenotypes, such as helping those who help others. Here, we test these assortative hypotheses among the Agta, a population of Filipino hunter-gatherers, using an experimental resource allocation game in which individuals divide resources between themselves and camp-mates. Individuals preferentially shared with less cooperative individuals, arguing against cooperative assortativity as a mechanism sustaining resource transfers in this population. Rather, sharing was often based on the recipient's level of need, in addition to kin-based transfers and reciprocal sharing. Contrary to several recent theoretical accounts, in this real-world setting we ﬁnd no evidence for cooperative assortativity inﬂuencing patterns of cooperation. These results may reﬂect the demands of living in a foraging ecology characterized by high resource stochasticity, necessitating need-based sharing as a system of long-term reciprocity to mitigate repeated subsistence shortfalls.},

While chimpanzee social life may apparently suggest significant parallels with proto-human society, it must not be forgotten that, despite their genetic closeness, chimpanzees have a separate evolutionary history of at least 5 million years and have successfully adapted to a forest rather than savanna ecology. Modern hunter-gatherers are anatomically modern people whose economies have been developed in the face of cultural, environmental and historical pressures that are quite different from those encountered by the first species of Homo (Leacock 1978). Such societies, and those of hunters in the recent past, cannot be assumed to represent an ancestral state. At best they may approximate only to the economies of the final phase of prehistory.

	abstract = {Human beings are a very different kind of animal. We have evolved to become the most dominant species on Earth. We have a larger geographical range and process more energy than any other creature alive. This astonishing transformation is usually explained in terms of cognitive ability—people are just smarter than all the rest. But in this compelling book, Robert Boyd argues that culture—our ability to learn from each other—has been the essential ingredient of our remarkable success.

A Different Kind of Animal demonstrates that while people are smart, we are not nearly smart enough to have solved the vast array of problems that confronted our species as it spread across the globe. Over the past two million years, culture has evolved to enable human populations to accumulate superb local adaptations that no individual could ever have invented on their own. It has also made possible the evolution of social norms that allow humans to make common cause with large groups of unrelated individuals, a kind of society not seen anywhere else in nature. This unique combination of cultural adaptation and large-scale cooperation has transformed our species and assured our survival—making us the different kind of animal we are today.

Based on the Tanner Lectures delivered at Princeton University, A Different Kind of Animal features challenging responses by biologist H. Allen Orr, philosopher Kim Sterelny, economist Paul Seabright, and evolutionary anthropologist Ruth Mace, as well as an introduction by Stephen Macedo.},

	abstract = {ObjectivesRelative to industrialized populations, men from subsistence groups exhibit lower testosterone values and more modest declines with age. Limited energy availability has been hypothesized to suppress testosterone production, particularly during young adulthood when testosterone levels are highest, resulting in a flatter trajectory of age-decline. Energetic constraint, however, is not unique to the evolutionary ecology of humans, and yet significant age-related testosterone decline is observed in numerous species of wild primates. Conversely, human life history is distinguished by extensive bi-parental care and male provisioning. Because fathers show decreased testosterone with parenting effort, we argue that within more naturalistic and evolutionarily relevant ecologies, natural fertility and earlier reproduction suppresses testosterone in emerging adulthood such that a lower relative baseline dictates less age-decline across the remaining lifespan.MethodsWe examine men’s testosterone levels as contrasting functions of energetic status and paternal involvement across three traditional populations with substantial variability in men’s nutritional condition and parental investment. Anthropometric and demographic data along with saliva samples were collected from 70 Datoga, 29 Hadza, and 43 Qom men, ages 20–72 years.ResultsPopulation variation in salivary testosterone was greatest at younger ages and patterned so paternal involvement associated with lower morning and evening testosterone, along with diminished age-decline in both measures. Men’s energetic status as indicated by body mass index was not associated with testosterone values or age-related decline.ConclusionsWithin socioecological contexts of smaller scale society, these data suggest that blunted age-decline in men’s testosterone levels is primarily due to population variation in parental investment rather than energetic constraint.},

	abstract = {In the developing world, the dramatic male bias in tobacco use is usually ascribed to pronounced gender disparities in social, political, or economic power. This bias might also reflect under-reporting by woman and/or over-reporting by men. To test the role of gender inequality on gender differences in tobacco use we investigated tobacco use among the Aka, a Congo Basin foraging population noted for its exceptionally high degree of gender equality. We also tested a sexual selection hypothesis—that Aka men’s tobacco use is related to risk taking. Tobacco use, income, tobacco purchases, tobacco sharing, reasons for using tobacco, risk taking, and other variables were measured using structured surveys and peer reports. Tobacco use was verified by testing for salivary cotinine, a nicotine metabolite. Contrary to expectations, we found a very large male bias in tobacco use. Low levels of use among females appeared to be explained by aversions to tobacco, concerns over its negative effects on fetal health, and a desire to attract husbands, who prefer nonsmoking wives. High male use appeared to be related to a desire to enhance hunting abilities and attract and/or retain wives, who prefer husbands that smoke. We conclude that low levels of smoking by Aka women are better explained by the hypothesis that women evolved to avoid plant toxins to protect their fetuses and nursing infants. High male use might be better explained by sexual selection. We also highlight the important role that recreational drugs appear to play in hunter-gatherer sharing relationships.},

In this thesis, I present a dynamic state variable model for the optimization of reproductive scheduling under a range of family and environmental contexts.

Leading explanations to account for this pattern are: (1) direct provisioning of hunters’ wives and offspring, (2) dyadic reciprocity, (3) indirect reciprocity, (4) costly signaling, and (5) phenotypic correlation. I examine the qualitative and quantitative evidence bearing on these explanations and conclude that although none can be definitively rejected, extensive and apparently unconditional sharing of large game somewhat weakens the first three explanations.

While men preferred higher pitched women's voices as marriage partners, women showed no overall preference for voice pitch in men. However, women who were currently breastfeeding had stronger preferences for higher pitched male voices whereas women not currently breastfeeding preferred lower pitched voices. As testosterone is considered a costly signal associated with dominance, heritable immunity to infection and low paternal investment, women's preferences potentially reflect a trade-off between securing good genes and paternal investment.

We highlight the role these factors play in the flexibility of gorilla, chimpanzee, bonobo, and human behavior. Given humans have an especially broad range of intergroup behavior, we explore how the human foraging ecology, especially large spatial and temporal fluctuations in resource availability, may have selected for a greater reliance on tolerant between-community relationships—relationships reinforced by status acquisition and cultural institutions. We conclude by urging careful, theoretically motivated study of behavioral flexibility in intergroup encounters in humans and the nonhuman great apes.},

	abstract = {Selection pressure from health risk is hypothesized to have shaped adaptations motivating individuals to attempt to become valued by other individuals by generously and recurrently providing beneficial goods and/or services to them because this strategy encouraged beneficiaries to provide costly health care to their benefactors when the latter were sick or injured. Additionally, adaptations are hypothesized to have co-evolved that motivate individuals to attend to and value those who recurrently provide them with important benefits so they are willing in turn to provide costly care when a valued person is disabled or in dire need. Individuals in egalitarian foraging bands can provide a number of valuable benefits, such as defense, diplomacy, food, healing, information, technical skill, or trading savvy. We therefore expect that humans have evolved psychological mechanisms motivating the pursuit and cultivation of a difficult-to-replace social role based on the provisioning of a benefit that confers a fitness advantage on its recipients. We call this phenomenon social niche specialization. One such niche that has been well-documented is meat-sharing. Here we present cross-cultural evidence that individuals cultivate two other niches, information and tool production, that serve (among other things) to buffer health risk.},

This theory explains little about the division of labor among the Australian Martu, where women hunt extensively and gendered asymmetry in foraging decisions is linked to men’s and women’s different social strategies. Women hunt primarily small, predictable game (lizards) to provision small kin networks, to feed children, and to maintain their cooperative relationships with other women. They trade off large harvests against greater certainty. Men hunt as a political strategy, using a form of “competitive magnanimity” to rise in the ritual hierarchy and demonstrate their capacity to keep sacred knowledge. Resources that can provision the most people with the most meat best fit this strategy, resulting in an emphasis on kangaroo. Men trade off reliable consumption benefits to the hunter’s family for more unpredictable benefits in social standing for the individual hunter. Gender differences in the costs and benefits of engaging in competitive magnanimity structure men’s more risk‐prone and women’s more risk‐averse foraging decisions.},

Throughout their history foragers have been making strategic decisions about whether to incorporate new resources and technologies. This appears to be both the strength and resilience of hunter-gatherer lifeways. Despite recognition that hunting and gathering includes broad-spectrum subsistence options, an assumption is commonly made that the incorporation of domesticates leads to a directional shift toward greater reliance on food production. In this chapter we consider instead how the adoption of some horticultural practices supports the continued viability of, and primary reliance on, hunting and gathering. Although the Pumé live in close proximity to and interact with their horticultural relatives, they have not assimilated into their communities or become sedentary and increasingly reliant on horticulture. We explore how a combination of both economic and social factors are critical to their retention of a mobile foraging way of life and helps to explain why hunting and gathering remains a viable, and even desirable subsistence choice in the twenty-first century.},

Here, we explore the factors that lead to daily variation in how much men produce relative to women among Martu, contemporary foragers of the Western Desert of Australia. We analyze variation in foraging decisions on temporary foraging camps and find that the percentage of total camp production provided by each gender varies primarily as a function of men’s average bout successes with large, mobile prey. When men target large prey, either their success leads to a large proportional contribution to the daily harvest, or their failure results in no contribution. When both men and women target small reliable prey, production inequalities by gender are minimized. These results suggest that production inequalities among Martu emerge from stochastic variation in men’s foraging success on large prey measured against the backdrop of women’s consistent production of small, low-variance resources.},

We predict that as resources are more difficult to extract, juvenile baboons will demonstrate lower efficiency than adults will because of their lower levels of experience. In addition, we hypothesize that juvenile baboons will be more likely to allocate foraging time to easier-to-extract resources owing to their greater efficiency in acquiring those resources.We use feeding efficiency and time allocation data collected on a wild, free-ranging, non-provisioned population of chacma baboons (Papio hamadryas ursinus) in the Moremi Wildlife Reserve, Okavango Delta, Botswana to test these hypotheses. The major findings of this study are:1. Juvenile baboons are significantly less efficient foragers than adult baboons primarily for difficult-to-extract resources.We propose that this age-dependent variation in efficiency is due to differences in memory and other cognitive functions related to locating food resources, as is indicated by the greater amount of time juvenile baboons spend searching for food. There is no evidence that smaller body size or competitive disruption influences the differences in return rates found between adult and juvenile baboons in this study.2. An individual baboon’s feeding efficiency for a given resource can be used to predict the duration of its foraging bouts for that resource.These results contribute both to our understanding of the ontogeny of behavioral development in nonhuman primates, especially regarding foraging ability, and to current debate within the field of human behavioral ecology regarding the evolution of the juvenile period in primates and humans.},

	abstract = {In this article we seek to build on efforts to apply the insights of social learning theory to interpret patterns of continuity and change in the archaeological record. This literature suggests that stable and often highly arbitrary material culture traditions are likely to be founded on our biologically evolved capacity for imitation. However, it has recently been argued that the latter may be insufficient to explain the long-term maintenance of complex and difficult-to-master skills, such as those required to produce stone tools, pots, textiles and other cognitively opaque cultural forms. To ensure that these skills are accurately transferred to the next generation, adults must actively guide and control the learning activities of their children, a mode of transmission that can be labelled 'pedagogy'. The importance of pedagogy has often been overlooked in the theoretical and empirical literature on craft learning, a fact that can probably be attributed to an unnecessarily narrow conception of teaching that equates it with explicit linguistic instruction. Using ethnographic data gathered from detailed case studies, we characterize pedagogy in the context of craft apprenticeships as involving the gradual scaffolding of skill in a novice through demonstration, intervention and collaboration. Although these processes cannot be directly observed in the archaeological record, they can sometimes be inferred through the detailed reconstruction of operational chains in past technologies. The evidence we present suggests that pedagogy has played an essential role in securing the faithful transmission of skills across generations, and should be regarded as the central mechanism through which long-term and stable material culture traditions are propagated and maintained.},

We test this hypothesis among Martu hunters and find that cooperation only provides increased returns to poorer hunters while disadvantaging better hunters. Even so, better hunters still cooperate as frequently as poorer hunters. We ask whether better hunters are advantaged in secondary sharing distributions or whether they bias their partner choice to kin or household members. We find that better hunters are not more likely to pair up with kin and they do not gain consumption benefits from acquiring more. They share a greater proportion of their harvest than poorer hunters: no matter how much one produces — better hunter, worse hunter, cooperator, solitary hunter — all eat the same amount in the end. Such a result suggests the hypothesis that cooperation might be a costly signal of commitment to the public interest on the part of better hunters, which generates trust among camp members and facilitates strong social networks, particularly among women, who cooperate more than men. While some foragers may benefit through cooperation from returns to scale or risk reduction, others may benefit more through signaling commitment and generating trust.},

	abstract = {The human diet has undergone substantial modiﬁcations since the emergence of modern humans and varies considerably in today's traditional societies. Despite these changes and cross-cultural diﬀerences, the human diet can be characterized by several common elements. These include diverse, high quality foods, technological complexity to acquire and process food, and the establishment of home bases for storage, processing and consumption. Together these aspects of the human diet challenge any one individual to independently meet all of his or her daily caloric needs. Humans solve this challenge through food sharing, labor exchange and the division of labor. The cooperative nature of the human diet is associated with many downstream eﬀects on our life history and physiology. This paper overviews the constellation of traits that likely led to a cooperative economy of food, and draws on ethnographic examples to illustrate its eﬀects on human life history and physiology. Two detailed examples using body composition, time allocation and food acquisition data show how cooperation among Savanna Pumé hunter-gatherers aﬀects activity levels, sexual dimorphism in body fat, maturational pace and age at ﬁrst birth.},

Interethnic interactions have ranged from severe maltreatment of the Basarwa by other groups to a kind of paternalistic interest in their welfare. The Basarwa have tended to become part of the lowest class in a multitiered socioeconomic system in Botswana.},

	abstract = {In this paper we describe seasonal variation in the diet, subsistence work effort, and sexual division of labor among Hiwi foragers of Venezuela. The major findings are: (1) The Hiwi diet is characterized by stability in hunted resources but extreme seasonality in vegetable resource types. (2) Men and women show significant seasonal variations in subsistence work effort and, therefore, in the character of the sexual division of labor. (3) Significant seasonal weight changes for each sex are observed. (4) Female fertility patterns vary seasonally, and this variation appears to be highly correlated with changes in "net" energy intake throughout the year. We suggest that a consideration of the individual fitness consequences of behavioral options for each sex may provide some insight into sex differences in behavior across seasons.},

	abstract = {Among immediate-return societies, cooperative social relationships are maintained despite the lack of centralized authority, strong norms of ownership and the punishment of free-riders. The prosocial signaling theory of cooperation solves the puzzle of social cohesion in such societies by suggesting that costly forms of generosity can function as an honest signal of prosocial intent, and that the reputations for prosociality signalers build generate trust between individuals, supporting the formation of cooperative partnerships. However, not all forms of costly generosity are prosocial: we contrast two types of generosity, aggrandizing and prosocial, and suggest that only prosocial generosity provides beneﬁts through cooperation. Prosocial generosity is accompanied by pecuniary distancing: the payment of a higher relative cost to share, and a manner of sharing that disengages the acquirer from ownership over the rights to beneﬁt from his or her harvest. We test the prosocial sharing hypothesis among Martu hunters and ﬁnd that there is a signiﬁcant association between the propensity of an individual to share a higher proportion of her income and centrality in the cooperative hunting network. Those who consistently pay higher costs to share, not necessarily those who are better hunters, are preferred partners for cooperative hunting. While many have emphasized the direct, status enhancing, competitive aspects of generosity, we suggest here that prosocial generosity produces beneﬁts indirectly, through the formation of trusting, cooperative partnerships.},

	abstract = {Anthropological tests of patch choice models from optimal foraging theory have primarily employed acquisition rates as the currency of the model. Where foragers share their returns, acquisition rates may not be similar to consumption rates and thus may not be an appropriate currency to use when modeling foraging decisions. Indeed, on Ifaluk Atoll the distribution patterns of fish vary by fishing method and location. Previous analyses of Ifaluk patch choice decisions suggested that if Ifaluk fishers are trying to maximize their production rates they should rarely torch fish for dogtoothed tuna. However, some men do spend considerable time and energy exploiting the dogtoothed tuna patch. To improve our understanding of the constraints and motivations influencing men’s decisions to exploit this patch, here I use per capita consumption rates as a currency, rather than production rates, to evaluate predictions generated from a patch choice model. Results indicate that although fish caught in other patches are more widely distributed than fish caught in the dogtoothed tuna patch, the consumption rates of torch fishers and their kin are still considerably lower than the consumption rates of men pursuing fish in other patches. Although these results are unable to explain why Ifaluk men exploit the dogtoothed tuna patch, an important explanatory hypothesis is eliminated.},

Although sharing patterns vary by resource type and package size, much of the food available at the reservation is given to members of just a few other families. We find significant positive correlations between amounts transferred among pairs of families, a measure of the "contingency" component required of reciprocal altruism models. These preferred sharing partners are usually close kin. We explore implications of these results in light of predictions from current sharing models.},

	abstract = {There is a very striking difference between even the simplest ethnographically known human societies and those of the chimps and bonobos. Chimp and bonobo societies are closed societies: with the exception of adolescent females who disperse from their natal group and join a nearby group (never to return to their group of origin), a pan residential group is the whole social world of the agents who make it up. That is not true of forager bands, which have fluid memberships, and regular associations with neighbouring bands. They are components of a larger social world. The open and fluid character of forager bands brings with it many advantages, so the stability of this more vertically complex form of social life is not difficult to explain, once it establishes. But how did it establish, if, as is likely, earlier hominin social worlds resemble those of our close pan relatives in the suspicion (even hostility) of one band to another? How did hominin social organisation transition from life in closed bands, each distrustful of its neighbours, to the much more open social lives of foragers? I will discuss and synthesise two approaches to this problem, one ecological, based on the work of Robert Layton and his colleagues, and another that is organised around an expansion of kin recognition, an idea primarily driven by Bernard Chapais. The paper closes by discussing potential archaeological signatures both of more open social worlds, and of the supposed causal drivers of such worlds.},

Adaptive explanations of menopause offered thus far turn on women’s long-term investment in offspring and grandoffspring, all variations on the grandmother hypothesis. Here, I offer a very different explanation. The patriarch hypothesis proposes that once males became capable of maintaining high status and reproductive access beyond their peak physical condition, selection favored the extension of maximum life span in males. Because the relevant genes were not on the Y chromosome, life span increased in females as well. However, the female reproductive span was constrained by the depletion of viable oocytes, which resulted in menopause.},

	abstract = {A recently developed visual foraging task, involving multiple targets of different types, can provide a rich and dynamic picture of visual attention performance. We measured the foraging performance of 66 children aged 4–7 years, along with measures of two conceptually related constructs, self-regulation and verbal working memory. Our results show that foraging patterns of young children differ from adult patterns. Children have difficulty with foraging for two target types, not only when they are defined by a conjunction of features but, unlike adults, also when they forage simultaneously for two target types that are distinguished from distractors by a single feature. Importantly, such feature/conjunction differences between adults and children are not seen in more traditional single-target visual search tasks. Interestingly, the foraging patterns of the youngest children were slightly more adult-like than of the oldest ones, which may suggest that older children attempt to use strategies that they have not yet fully mastered. The older children were, however, able to complete more trials, during both feature and conjunction foraging. Self-regulation and verbal working memory did not seem to affect foraging strategies, but both were connected with faster and more efficient foraging. We propose that our visual foraging paradigm is a promising avenue for studying the development of visual cognitive abilities.},

These data indicate that chimpanzees are aggressive, dominance-seeking and fiercely territorial. Reports from a number of naturalistic (nonprovisioning, unobtrusive) field studies contrast sharply. All report open groups of nonaggressive, nonhierarchical chimpanzees, which repeatedly fission for foraging and reunite as a larger social group. Because of the authority accorded the Mahale and Gombe reports, the naturalistic studies are often discounted. In this paper foraging theory is used to show that the recent behaviors of the artificially fed apes are maladaptive, while those of the nonprovisioned, wild chimpanzees are excellent foraging strategy. It is suggested, but not concluded, that the recent behaviors of the Gombe and Mahale chimpanzees may be frustration-induced responses to feeding methods which introduce a blockage between the apes and the desirable bait foods.},

	abstract = {SummaryThe effects of sex and seasonal changes in food abundance on foraging behavior was studied in squirrel monkeys (Saimiri oerstedi) in Costa Rica over an eleven-month period. Females searched for and ate food at significantly greater frequencies than did males throughout the study. The frequency of the specific foraging techniques used occasionally differed significantly within seasons, but not across the study period. Few differences were found in the foraging behaviors of nonreproductive sexually mature females compared to females that were pregnant or lactating. The major exception was that during the month following parturition reproductive females foraged for flowers and fruits more frequently than did non-reproductive females. The reduction of time spent by males in foraging activities gives them more time for other activities, especially anti-predator vigilance. Foraging techniques and the proportions of different food types in the diet changed seasonally. Foraging for arthropods was most frequent in the season when arthropod abundance was lowest, resulting in the amount of time spent eating arthropods to vary less across the seasons. Fruits and flowers were not eaten in a direct relationship to availability, but were used more than expected relative to availability when arthropod abundance was reduced. Individuals were more dispersed when foraging compared to other activities. Overall, there was little evidence of any direct foraging benefits for a squirrel monkey from being social.},

We combine ethnographic observations of contemporary Aboriginal hunting and burning with satellite image analysis of anthropogenic and natural landscape structure to demonstrate the processes through which Aboriginal burning shapes arid-zone vegetational diversity. Anthropogenic landscapes contain a greater diversity of successional stages than landscapes under a lightning fire regime, and differences are of scale, not of kind. Landscape scale is directly linked to foraging for small, burrowed prey (monitor lizards), which is a specialty of Aboriginal women. The maintenance of small-scale habitat mosaics increases small-animal hunting productivity. These results have implications for understanding the unique biodiversity of the Australian continent, through time and space. In particular, anthropogenic influences on the habitat structure of paleolandscapes are likely to be spatially localized and linked to less mobile, "broad-spectrum" foraging economies.},
