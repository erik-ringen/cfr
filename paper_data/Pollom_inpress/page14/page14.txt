When combining the sum of all foraging returns for each forager and analyzing ages as a continuous variable, there was a weak correlation between age and foraging returns in 2005 (r=0.218, p=0.266) and a moderate relationship in 2017 (r=0.381, p=0.088). However, when analyzing the sum of individual foraging returns, age was not a significant predictor of the amount of kcals collected in 2005 (p=0.288, df=26, R2=0.04, n=27) or 2017 (p=0.688, df=20, R2=0.009, n=21). Therefore, when analyzing only the foods brought back to camp (not accounting for amount consumed while foraging), age did not appear to have a significant impact on foraging returns.
