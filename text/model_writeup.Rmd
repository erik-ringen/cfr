## Generative model

Assume that individuals go on foraging trips in which they successfully acquire some return ($y > 0$) with probability $1-p$ or come home empty-handed ($y = 0$) with probability $p$. Further assume that non zero returns follow a log-normal distribution. Observed foraging returns are thus mapped onto a "hurdle" model where:

$$ f(y) = \textrm{Bernoulli}(p)  ~~~~\textrm{if}~~y=0 \\ $$
$$ f(y) = (1-p) [\textrm{LogNormal}(\textrm{log}(\mu),\sigma)] ~~~~\textrm{if}~~y>0  $$

Previous studies of human foraging returns have found that both the probability of a zero-return and the quantity of returns depends on forager skill ($S$), which varies across the lifespan. As a directed acyclic graph: $\textrm{age} \rightarrow S \rightarrow p$ and $S \rightarrow \mu$. Koster et al. modeled the relationship between age and $S$ as a concave downward function to account for senescence among older adults. However, our focus was on the returns of foragers below age 20---more than a decade earlier than the estimated peak of foraging skill, so we did not model senescence. Otherwise, we used the same functional form as Koster et al. (2019) and Lew-Levy et al. (2021) to describe change in latent foraging skill with age:

$$S(\textrm{age}) = [1 - \textrm{exp}(-k\times \textrm{age})]^{b}$$


Where $k$ is the constant rate of growth in foraging skill and $b$ is an elasticity parameter that determines the proportional change in skill. $b$ < 1 indicates diminishing returns (decreasing differentials of skill with age), while $b$ > 1 indicates accelerating returns (increasing differentials of skill with age). Skill itself may have nonlinear effects on foraging success, which we model as an additional elasticity parameter $\eta$. $k$, $b$, and $\eta$ were assumed positive, which means that skill is strictly increasing with age and that higher skill always has a positive effect on foraging returns. Finally, we add the log-linear $\alpha$, which acts as an intercept for foraging returns, independent of age.

$$ \mu = S^{\eta_{[\mu]}}\alpha_{\mu} $$ 
$$ p = 2[\textrm{logit}^{-1}(S^{\eta_{[p]}}\alpha_{p}) - \frac{1}{2}] $$

## Measurement error in adult mean return

We scaled child foraging returns by the mean return for foragers age $\geq$ 20. To propagate uncertainty in mean adult returns, for each outcome in each study we treated it as a parameter ($y_{\mu[\textrm{Adult}]}$) with known Gaussian error (the standard error of the mean), such that:

$$ \mathbb{E}(y_{\textrm{[adult]}}) \sim \textrm{Normal}(\bar{y}_{[\textrm{Adult}]},\sigma_{\bar{y}_{[\textrm{Adult}]}}) $$

One complication is that the sample mean and standard error of the mean will be deflated by the inclusion of zero return values. Note that the expectation of $y$ under our generative model is:

$$ \mathbb{E}(y) = (1 - p)[\textrm{exp}(\mu~+~\frac{\sigma^2}{2})] $$
$$ \textrm{Var(y)} = [\textrm{exp}(\sigma^2) - 1] \textrm{exp}(2\mu + \sigma^2) $$

Because we want to partition zero and non-zero returns among children, we should only scale by the non-zero adult returns. Which means that the sample mean $\bar{y}$ will always be less than the quantity we actually want $\bar{y}|y>0$. But the average of non-zero returns can be recovered:

$$\bar{y}|y>0 = \frac{\bar{y}}{(1 - p)}$$
If an average $\bar{p}$ is not available for adult data, we use $p|\textrm{age} = 20$ as a rough estimate.

Similarly, to adjust the standard error of the mean so as to remove the effect of zero-returns,we estimate:

$$ \sigma_{\bar{y}|y \geq 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\textrm{var}(y|y >0)}{n}}$$
Where $n$ is the sample size among adults.

$$ \textrm{var}(y|y>0) = \frac{\textrm{var}(y)}{(1 - p)} - p[\bar{y}|y>0]^2 $$
Where $\textrm{var}(y)$ is just $(\sigma_{\bar{y}}^2)n$. Therefore we can adjust otherwise biased adult estimates of foraging returns in light of zero-return rates derived from the data.

## Integrating individual-level data with study-level summary statistics

Our data included a mix of individual-level returns and summary statistics, such as the mean and standard deviation of returns for children/adults.

## What if no adult returns are available?



## Individual differences


## Adding predictors


## Uncertainty in age 


## Uncertainty in sex


Absolute values of foraging returns are not likely to be directly comparable between or even within studies (if, for example the study reported returns for two different resource types). However, the target of our meta-analysis was not absolute production, but instead children's foraging productivity \it{relative} to adults. Therefore we scaled returns $y$ by the mean adult return in a given study and resource type.
