Shellfish collecting efficiency across age categories. Mean foraging efficiency (kcai/hr) across age categories in shellfish collecting for 49 individuals observed in 81 follows. Error bars represent the 98% confidence interval for the mean return rates in each category. There is a significant effect of age cat- egory on foraging efficiency (ANOVA: df = 30, F ---3.347, p = .0222). Post-hoc tests reveal significant differences between adults 30-50 and all those under 30, and between the youngest and oldest age categories (see Table 5).
