ISSUES
-Bird_2002b Table2
	-values around the mean (mean plusminus number) are not defined. Interpreted as SE, given that is the measure used in the other tables, although this is not stated

-BliegeBird_1995 Table 3
	Notes on time from Caption: Foraging time includes travel, search and handling (harvesting and field processing)
	Egg time does not include travel time to the patch, which was shared with travel to the intertidal patch
	since egg collecting occurred within an intertidal foraging episode. To obtain total egg time, add 161 minutes to boy 1 and 2,
	103 to boy 5, 58 to girl 8

-BliegeBird_2002a Fig1a 
	y values are Residual overall returns (Kcal/hr+travel)

-BliegeBird_2002a Fig1b
	y values are Residual Beach Fishing Efficiency (Kcal/hr E/T)
	I think we can use the adult values of fig1a, same paper. But I would like second opinion.

-BliegeBird_2002a Fig2 and table
	Error reported as CI98. SD calculated as SD = sqr(N) * (upper limit - lower limit)/3.92. This is a reliable calculation for sample sizes above 100 per group, hence not in this case. But we can compare the measure with the one in the table.
	Hence, better to use the data presented in the associated table (and the r script for those) instead of the figure
