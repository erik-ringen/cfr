Spearfishing efficiency across age/experience categories. Best man: n = 9 follows; Child, n = 5 individuals under the age of 15 with more than 9 fol- lows; Other man: n = 9 less-practiced individuals with 14 follows. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals for the mean. No significant differences (Fisher's PLSD) between the best man and children (p = .6967).
