\section*{Abstract}
Children forage in a vast array of societies, spanning from traditional hunter gatherer groups, such as the Hadza, to Mexican shanty towns. Data on their success, though, is sparse and a coherent framework is missing altogether. With this paper we aim at both reviewing the extant literature on children foraging and at summarizing available return data in a single coherent meta-analytical framework.
